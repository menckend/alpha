summary: "Describing the dynamics of this scenario in a graph-theory framework"

*Is* there any value in using a graph-theory framework to describe the topology of the simplest design-case in which the "problem" we seek to address occurs?  Probably(?), but lets try it and find out.

To do this, we will regard each BGP speaker as a "edge" in a graph, and each BGP-session between them as the vertices of a symmetric directed graph.
