Like most folks who've knocked around in the network-technology world for any length of time, I've been plagued throughout my career by "MTU issues."  A couple of years ago, a bunch of them piled up at once for me and I went fishing for some *reason* that these issues never stopped showing up, thinking:

> * What  _gives_ ?
>   * Is there something fundamentally unsolvable?
>   * Is there something weâ€™re all just doing wrong?
>   * Did this all get fixed\, and I just missed a memo?

The result of that extended fishing expedition is this "MTU Manifesto."  I hope that it inspires you to at least think about the context in which our collective/reflexive approaches to MTU came from, and to what extent they are/aren't valid in the contemporary enterprise IT context.

Enjoy!
