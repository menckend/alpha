If two hosts on *different* IP subnets have different (but otherwise valid) MTU values, they may still experience apparent packet loss and subsequent application-layer performance impact if the host with the larger MTU attempts to send a packet that is larger than the other host's MTU.  

This may also occur if the two hosts have identical MTUs, but even a single device's network interface along the path between them has a lower MTU.

This will occur if any of the following are true:

- Either host fails to implement path MTU discovery in a conformant manner
- Any of the network infrastructure between the two hosts
  - Fails to generate ICMP PTB messages when it should generate them
  - Fails to forward ICMP PTB messages when it should

A study in 2010 determined that ~80-85% of traffic to public web-servers implement PMTUD correctly and successfully. By inference, that means that ~15-20% of web traffic does *not* have working/end-to-end PMTUD.  A firewall policy that blocks the ICMP PTB messages; a CSP-native networking construct that doesn't bother *generating* ICMP PTB messages in the first place; there are *always* unlit corners of the network where gremlins get together and break PMTUD.
