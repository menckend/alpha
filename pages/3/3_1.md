summary:  "Not everything needs a load-balancer"

## The Take

Pay *attention* to *why* you're putting network load-balancers in front of various workloads.  I'm positive that you're trying to achieve one or both of the following:
 - To allow the back-end workload to scale its capacity horizontally
 - To provide some additional measure of resiliency to the back-end workload

If the existing hosting context for the backend workload doesn't *have* a capacity-scaling requirement that it can't already meet, and it doesn't *have* an un-solved resiliency requirement -- *ask* yourself why you're trying to put a network load-balancer in front of it.

Don't let the decades of muscle-memory fool you.  If you grew up in a world where literal *racks* of web-servers sat behind a network load-balancer, you probably asked those questions once or twice decades ago and stopped asking them pretty quickly, because the answers never seemed to change.

But, the world *does* keep moving on, and if you have containerized workload running in a Kubernetes cluster?  Well, the Kubernetes platform itself is (should be, anyway) already doing both of the jobs that the network load-balancer was historically asked to do.

## TL/DR

Don't put network load-balancers in front of your workload if you're just going to be providing clunkier solutions for problems that have already been solved for by the workload's hosting platform.
