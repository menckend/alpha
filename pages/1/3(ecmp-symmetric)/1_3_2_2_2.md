In order for flows to succeed they must traverse the same *stateful* hops in each direction.  If we are to solve this using routing policy, we'll need to describe the potential paths in terms of those stateful hops.

And, because we're concerned with symmetry, we'll need to find a way of parsing those descriptions that creates the same results when evaluated "forwards" and "backwards."  Given that a flow consists of packets moving in both direcitons between two endpoints (A and B). Our algorithm will need to yield paths with the same stateful hops for both the A->B and B->A directions.  

We can *characterize* those paths based on the following properties:
- Source properties
  - The security-zone-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The site-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Destination properties
  - The security-zone-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The site-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Whether the path traverses the transit-zone in site-0 (the WAN.)

We can make several useful statements 
- We can classify any packet as "low-to-high" or "high-to-low" with regards to both security-zone-ID and site-ID.
  - Having assigned a(n arbitrary) numerical index to each security-zone and each site
  - In a given flow, if A->B is "low-to-high", we know that B->A will be "high-to-low"
    - That is, a comparison will yield "opposite" results for A->B and B->A directions of a given flow
- The topology that we have dictated ensures that for any inter-site/inter-zone flow, the available equal-cost paths will have the following distribution of stateful hops
  - Both firewalls in the "A" side (call it "path-1")
  - Both firewalls in the "B" side (call it "path-2")
  - One firewall in both the "A" side and the "B" side (call it "path-3")
