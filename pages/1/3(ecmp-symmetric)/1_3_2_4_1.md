Having (somehwat) formalized our definitions or "zone" and "site" as well a how represent them on a graph, we consider the innately hierarchical structures of each.

# Sites as a Recursive Concept

We previously established that our concept of "site" in the networks we are contemplating is:
> A region in space (or the set of network nodes in that space) for which we "prefer" paths between nodes "in" that site to remain local to.

This gives us a useful construct to address the the "real world" network desgin incentives to avoid un-needed high-latency hops between network nodes.  It's worth considering, though: 
> are there *other* properties of nodes (or the edges connecting them) that we might want to express a "locality" preference for?  Are those properties inherently recursive in structure?  Is there value to modeling that hierarchical structure in our graph?

Distance/locality *can*, obviously, be sub-divided in a hierarchical manner.   "Degree of resiliency" is another property that we *might* want to take into consideration when selecting paths cross the network/graph; it does *not* suggest an obviously recursive structure, but the related topic of failure domains *does*.  So, the mechanism we're using for expressing the "site"/distance/latency property of an edge might be adaptable to additional properties (some of which may be structured hierarchically) and the real-world phenomena of site/distance/latency definitely *can* be structured hierarchically.

Two key questions suggest themselves at this point:
> How would we recurse the "site" property model, if we want to.  And (of course) *do* we want to?

##  Hierarchical relationship of site "0" to other sites

The topology that we've described up to this point uses a distinctly hierarchical model for "site", which it inherits from the real-world topology our model is describing.  Each of our "workload-hosting" sites requires at least one connection to the WAN "site".

That is why we've used "0" as the value for the (parent) "WAN site", and "0.*n*" as the value for the (child) "workload hosting" sites.  The value represents a "stack" of both the parent's identifier ("0") and the child's identifier ("n").   We've further specified that edges connecting two nodes in site 0.*n* are labeled as "0.*n*.0".  This lets us indicate with the edge's label, whether it is connected to two nodes in the same site, or to two nodes in different sites, *and* which sites the nodes are located in.

That structure is trivially extensible if we want to recursively create further subdivisions of the network/graph.  If, for instance, our "workload sites" consisted of multiple "buildings" in a single metro region, we might prefer to have traffic stay local to a building, when possible, rather than bounce between buildings.  (But, that preference might be 10x or 100x less significant than the distinction between "WAN" and site.)  Likewise, if a given site had a workload cluster with its own overlay-network with routing gateways "connecting" it to the underlay network, similar dynamics could apply.

> We will use the term **"integral edge depth"** (IED) to refer to the number parent/child relationships that exist between a node the the top/root level of the site hierarchy.  The "WAN" (zone 0) contemplated above has an integral edge depth (IED) of "0"; "metro region sites" have an IED of "1", and "buildings" have an IED of "2."  "Integral edge" here is an allusion to the fact that the number of edges with labels that end with a non-zero-integer on the shortest path from any given node to a node in the top/root-level of the site-herarchy tell us how *deep* the given node sits in the site hierarchy.

## Creating recursive "site" structures in the graph

In the *WAN > site > building* hierarchy described above, the existing hierarchy is extended by one additional level.  The relation of "WAN" to "site" is the same as that of "site" to "building."  We would extend the labeling convention for the "site" property of edges by appending an additional "section" to the label (representing the "building" identifier, if there is one.)

The following figure depicts a modified version of the reference topology graph, incorporating *two* additional layers of recursion in the "site" property.  Site "0.1" (IED=1) is "split" into two sub-sites (0.1.1 and 0.1.2, each with IED=2), one of which (0.1.1) is further divided into two sub-sub-sites (0.1.1.1 and 0.1.1.2, each with IEDs of 3.)

The preceding figure also illustrates a new rule of inference for edges.  Specifically:

> Edges can only connect two nodes at the *same* layer of the site hierarchy or in immediately adjacent layers of the site hierarchy

That rule only "makes sense" if the "site hierarchy" really *is* strictly hierarchical. It's certainly easy to imagine scenarios in which "site" (or any other property we want to model this way) might be strictly hiearchical, or might be much "looser" (allowing edges between nodes in non-neighboring levels of the site hierarchy.)


### Better Illustrating the Recursion

The following figure presents an alternate arrangement of the same graph, which more intuitively illustrates the recursive nature of its the site hierarchy.
