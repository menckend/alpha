The previous section specified three distinct site-level hosting topologies for integrating stateful services into a mutli-zone/multi-site environment.

We will consider the path selection problems not for for inter-site/inter-zone flows between endpoints in identical hosting topologies, but also for such flows between endpoints in *different* hosting topologies.

We do this in hope of making the framework we develope more generally applicable in real-world situations, where universal adherence to a single design standard is not guaranteed.

The pages in this section will address the following bi-directional inter-site/inter-zone flow scenarios:
- 2x option-1 endpoints
- 2x option-2 endpoints
- 2x option-3 endpoints
- Option-1 & option-2 endpoints
- Option-1 & Option-3 endpoints
- Option-2 & Option-3 endpoints
- 

We will document the expected BGP routes for the following pairs of endpoints in the amalagamated topology above (assuming eBGP peering with no policy configured to modify default behavior) in order to ensure that our framework accounts for flows between endpoints residing in different desing-option topologies.  (The two endpoints are notated here with the identifying information of the workload-zone VRF to which actual workload is attached.)

###### Leftovers; re-integrate this text later
We will consider topologies with permutations of the following design elements:
- Firewall instantiation/rules-of-inference
  - A single (HA pair or cluster) monolithic/multi-zone firewall per-site pattern
  - A single (HA pair or cluster) firewall per-site/per-zone pattern
- Inter-zone routing pattern
  - The (monolithic) firewall routes traffic directly between zones with*out* a BGP "hop" along the way  (single-VRF firewall)
  - The (monolithic) firewall routes traffic directly between zones *with* a BGP "hop" along the way (multi-VRF/internal-transit-zone firewall)
  - The firewall *only* routes traffic between the transit-zone and attached workload-zone.


In the first, firewalls are instantiated per-zone, and traffic between zones is routed on an explicitly instantiated transit-zone routing function.

In the preceding diagram, two workload-hosting network security zones have been deployed at each of two sites.  Each of those zones is extended between sites across the WAN.  In addition, a "transit zone" has been extended across the WAN between the two sites.

The three best (and equal cost) paths between site-1/zone-2 and site-2/zone-3 are illustrated above, and the AS-path of each of those paths is listed in the boxes at the bottom.

In the second topology, monolithic multizone per-site firewalls are deployed and are capable of routing traffic directly between zones

## Initial Analysis

In the first topology, inter-site/inter-zone flows traverse three equal-cost paths in both ("A-to-B" and "B-to-A") directions.
- Path "A" traverses the zone-2 FW and zone-3 FW in site-2  (and no firewalls in site-1)
- Path "B" traverses the zone-2 FW and zone-3 FW in site-1  (and no firewalls in site-2)
- Path "C" traverses the zone-2 FW in site-1 and the zone-3 F in site-2

Paths A and B both traverse firewalls at one site only, while path C traverses firewalls at both sites 1 and 2.  From an optimization perspective, path C is marginally preferable to paths A and B because it splits the firewall capacity consumption across the two sites.

In the second topology, there are only two equal-cost paths.  Path A traverses the site-1 firewall and path b traverses the site 2 firewall.  From an optimizaiton perspective, nothing recommends one path over the other.
