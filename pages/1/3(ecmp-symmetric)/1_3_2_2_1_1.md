summary: "What descriptors are avaialble and relevant to the desired path-selection?"
---

In order for bidrectional flows to succeed when traversing stateful inspection services, they must traverse the same *stateful* hops in each direction.  If we are to solve this using routing policy, we'll need to describe the potential paths in terms of those stateful hops.

Because we're concerned with symmetry, we'll need to find a way of parsing those descriptions that creates the same results when evaluated "forwards" and "backwards."  

Given that a flow consists of packets moving in both direcitons between two endpoints (A and B). Our algorithm will need to yield paths with the same stateful hops for both the A->B and B->A directions.  

We can *describe* those paths based on the following properties:
- Source properties
  - The security-zone-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The site-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Destination properties
  - The security-zone-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The site-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- In which site-ID(s) the packet traverses the transit-zone
