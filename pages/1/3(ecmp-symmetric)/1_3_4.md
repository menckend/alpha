# Recapping
We'll use our last depiction of the graph (pictured below) from the previous section as a starting point.

[![image](./grphth-19.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-19.svg){:target="_blank"}

If we want symmetrical paths (or at least, "symmetrical enough" that they hit the same stateful nodes) we need a criteria for path selection that chooses the same edges regardless of which of the two nodes is executing the decision.

As discussed in the preamble, the reason that existing forwarding selection mechanisms (BGP ECMP in this case) don't provide that symmetry is that their algorithms operate on hashes of characteristics of the source and destiation of the traffic, and those values are inverted for the two flows.

# Prefer the path with more stateful hops in the same site as the endpoint with the (numerically) higher zone

Using our example again (of the src/dst-inverted flow-pair for nodes "14" and "22"), let's (arbitrarily) assume that we wanted our 14->22/22->14 flow-pair to choose "*path A*" from the three equal-cost paths.

We will assume (for now -- we'll address the *how* shortly) that each node has knowledge of the stateful-value, site-value, and zone-value of each node in all three of these paths (*as an element of that path* -- *not* as a complete internal representation of the overall graph).

In the equal-length paths we have to choose from, we previously noted that:
* Path A  has two stateful nodes in site 0.1  (the same site as one of the endpoints -- node 14)
* Path B has two stateful nodes in site 0.3  (the same site as one of the endpoints -- node 22)
* Path C has one stateful node in the same site as each of the endpoints

How can we describe path A in a manner that it is consistently selected by each node it contains  when it is evaluating the 14->22 *and* 14->22 paths.

"*The path with the most stateful nodes in the same site as the destination/endpoint*", won't work -- because source and destination are inverted for the bi-directional flows.

We *could* use "*the path with the most stateful nodes in site 0.1*".  However, that would *not* be generalizable for paths that don't have an endpoint in site 0.1.

A much better option is:

> Select the path with the most stateful nodes with the same site-value as:
>   *My own site-value if my zone-value is *higher* than that of the destination/endpoint), or
>   *The *destination/endpoint* site-value if my zone-value is *lower* than that of the destination/endpoint.

With that selection mechanism, we are effectively using each node's *own* site-value and zone-value as *proxies* for the site/zone values of the source/startpoing node.  (In order to avoid using  source-based routing.)  

In the topology that we've described up ot this point, this will turn out to be *almost* sufficient, because site-value and zone-value of nodes in the paths remain consistent far-enough *into* the path, that by the time they both differ from that of the source/startpoint node, the nodes with equal-cost paths have already been traversed (mostly).

Let's walk through how this would work.

## Path-trace

### Node 14 to Node >22 path selection.

* Node 14 has three equi-distant paths (A, B, C) available to reach node 22. 
   * It selects the edge leading to node 23 (on path "A") as the "correct" path.  Here's how it reaches that decision
     * "traditional" (BPG-like) path-selection rules tell it that paths A, B, and C are each equally good ways to reach node 22.
       * So it has to use our "new" rule as a tie-braker
     * It compares its own security zone (locally configured) of "0.1" to the security zone of node 22 (learned through path UPDATE messages) of "0.3" and determines that since 0.3 is greater than 0.1, it should prefer the path that has the most stateful hops with the same **site**-value (also 0.3 -- also learned via path UPDATE messages) as node 22
     * It recognizes that path A has 2 stateful hops in site 0.3  (and 2 is more than the 1 and 0 for paths B and C.)
* Node 23 selects its edge leading to node 20 because that is that shortest path (5 nodes), all other paths include >5 nodes, so no "special" logic is required
* Node 20 chooses its edge leading to node 11, which chooses its edge to node 4, which chooses its edge to node 13, which chooses its edge to node 22.  (Each node along the way having a single "lowest-cost" path, and not requiring any tie-breaker.

### Node 22 to Node 14 path selection.

* Node 22 has three equidistant paths (A, B, C ) available to reach node 14.
  * It selects the edge leading to node 13 (on path "A") as the correct path
    * Since path-length value is the same for all three paths, the new tie-breaker logic is required
      * It compares its own security zone (0.3) to that of the "destination" (0.1) and realizes that *it* has the higher value, and it should therefore prefer the path with the most stateful hops that match its own site-value (also 0.3)
        * That is path "A" (with 2 stateful nodes in site 0.3; compared to 0 and 1 for paths B and C)
      * The edge to node 13 is the first entry in path "A" in node 22's path table
* Node 13 makes the same analysis (comparing between paths A and C, since path B now has a longer length) and selecting the edge to node 4.
  * 
* Node 4 has path A and C as equidistant options to reach node 14.
  * It selects path A via the edge to node 11, using the same equi-distant path tie-breaker logic that nodes 22 and 13 did
* Node 11 selects its edge leading to node 20 because that is that shortest path (3 nodes), all other paths include >3 nodes, so no "special" logic is required
  * And so on, through node 23 to node 14.


In *this* specific graph/topology, our new path-selection rule will work as intended.  This graph represents our reference network topology in steady-state, but what happens in various failure modes  (if we remove one or more edges or nodes from the graph; modeling link/device failure on a network?)

As we will see in the following page, the viability of this path selection mechanism for inter-site/inter-zone will require some additional logic/guard-rails
