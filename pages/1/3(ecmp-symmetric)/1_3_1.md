### Exposition

The leaders of a certain forward-looking enterprise's IT organization have a *vision*.  They think in terms of *"cattle, not pets"*, and *"scalability, not failability"* (aka *"resiliency, not redundancy."*)  They want to build out infrastrucutre that *embodies* these principles, so as to *enable* upper-layer services to do the same.  The guiding-principle is trivially expressed as:
 
> When feasible, avoid using a *single* instance of anytyhing. Instead, use *multiple* instances of that element running in parallel and providing resiliency for each other.  Design systems that are *innately* resilient.

They envision multiple sites in multiple regions running instances of the various applications that enable their core business functions, and they know that their info-sec/net-sec architecture requires their network to be segregated into discrete "network security zone."  They also (somehow?) read the abstract of this paper and recognize the difficulties that they will be confronted with.

They establish the following design objectives for the enterprise network:
- The network should provide an optimal path between any two endpoints
  - Traffic between endpoints in the *same* (network security) zone should not traverse *any* network firewalls
  - Traffic between endpoints in *separate* security zones should traverse *only one* firewall at the edge of each (source and desination) security zone
  - Traffic between endpoints in the *same* site should not exit that site in transit
- The network should provide a "high" level of resiliency

The enterprise works through multiple design iterations, getting incrementally closer to optimal pathing.  Each   However, the fundamental from the abstract remains:
`Existing mechanisms for path selection across ECMP links result in asymmetric forward/reverse paths.

The subsequent pages in this section illustrate and explicate various design iterations the led to the novel framework presented in the following section.
