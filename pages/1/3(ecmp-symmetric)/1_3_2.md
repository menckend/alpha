summary: "...in which we obtain optimized *and* symmetric paths across ECMP links "

### Exposition

The scenario discussed in the previous section is hardly unique.  It is one that enterprises confront with incresaed frequency as they transition from "traditional" IT hosting/delivery models to public-cloud/hybrid-cloud architectures.

The framework presented in this section addresses a generalized version of that scenario, described in the following design assumptions/objectives:
- The enterprise network will scale to *multiple* sites, running heterogeneous workloads
- Each site may have workload in multiple network security zones.
- Stateful insepctions services (network firewalls) will continue to be the required perimeter device on each network security zone
  - And will remain bound to site-scope with regards to state sychnornization / clustering
- Optimal pathing is preferred

### Key elements of the framework

- A generalized algorithm for path selection that results in symmetric paths between endpoints with ECMP paths between
-  A formalized transit-zone.
- Route-tagging (with BGP large-community strings)
