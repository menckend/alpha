summary: "Like a jigsaw puzzle with eight different right answers"
---

A primary focus of our analsysis will be whether an effective/managable policy framework for symmetric pathing is viable for all, some, or none of the designs/topologies we have contemplated up to this point.  In this page, we will formalize those design options and enumerate the expected BGP RIF/FIB behavior for each.

## Topology options for stateful-inspection service integration

Our analysis will consider multiple permutations of the following design-options/patterns:

### Pattern 1

This option utilizes per site / per-workload-zone firewall instances and has the following elements:

- Workload-zone VRFs and transit-zone VRFs are instantiated on each site's network infrastructure and are extended between sites
  - Transit-zone is extended to *all* sites
  - Workload-zones are only extended to sites if hosted-work is present at that site/zone
- A firewall is instantiated when a specific workload-hosting zone has workload present at a specific site
- Each FW has one interface in a site's transit-zone and one in a workload-hosting zone at the same site
- Each firewall has a unique BGP AS and is an eBGP peer with the site's transit VRF and the site's workload-VRF (of the zone it is "attached" to)
- All inter-zone routing within a site is performed by the site's L3-network infrastructure's transit-zone VRF

{% endcapture %}{% capture summary %}Show/hide diagram{% endcapture %}{% include details.html %}

> This pattern is topologically identical to a similar pattern in which monolithic firewalls are implemented, but are configured with per-workload-zone VRFs (with unique ASNs) and with no internal transit-VRF or route-leaking between them.  The result is Layer-3 isolated, per-zone paths through the firewalls.

### Pattern 2

This option utilizes per-site (monolithic) firewall instances with a single routing function and has the following elements:

- Workload-zone VRFs are instantiated on each site's network infrastructure and are extended between sites
- The transit-zone VRF is implemented on the WAN-site only and extended directly to a transit-zone interface on each site's firewall
- FWs have interfaces on the "transit zone" (peered directly to the WAN VRF)
- FWs have interfaces in multiple "workload-hosting zones" (instantiated as isolated VRFs in the site's network infrastructure)
- An interface in a specific workload-hosting zone is instantiated on the firewall *only* if workload is present/hosted in that zone at that site
- The firewall routes traffic between its interfaces, acting as a single BPG AS.

### Pattern 3

This option also utilizes per-site/monolithic firewall instances, but internally implements per-zone VRFs.  The following design elements are present
- Workload-zone VRFs are instantiated on each site's network infrastructure and are extended between sites
- The transit-zone VRF is implemented on the WAN-site only and extended directly to a transit-zone interface on each site's firewall
- FWs have interfaces on the "transit zone" (peered directly to the WAN VRF)
- FWs have interfaces, VRFs, and BGP ASNs in multiple "workload-hosting zones"
  - eBGP peering is configured between each VRF on the monolithic firewalls.

## Amalgamated Topology

We will base the remainder of our analysis on the reference topology below, which implements *each* of the three design patterns from the previous section at two sites. Doing this allows us to account for the nuances of traffic *between endpoints hosted in different design options/topologies*.

> The following pattern was used in assigning AS numbers (purely for ease of reference):  
> - Digit-1 signifies the BGP speaker's "device type" 
>   - "1" = standard router with no stateful inspection services; 
>   - "2" = firewall or other stateful insepction/enforcement device)
> - Digit-2 signifies the site in which the BGP speaker is located
> - Digit 3 signifies the (workload-hosting)"zone" in which the BGP speaker is connected
> - Digit-4 signifies the index/instance-number of device-type in the same zone and site.
