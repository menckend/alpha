summary: "A change to the actual topology"
---

This framework relies heavily on the concept of a transit-zone.  That is, a (network security) zone which is tasked exclusively with providing transport for traffic between other zones.  No workload/hosts are attached to this network, only transport nodes.  The "edge"/"perimeter" of this zone is its connection to the firewalls on the perimeter of all the other zones.

### The hidden/implicit transit zone
This "transit zone" is already an implicit element of any multi-zone topology in which multiple zones hang off different interfaces of a single firewall instance.  

Each "zone" of the firewall has a separately maintained rulebase/policy, which is applied as traffic enters/exits its interfaces (interfaces are associated to exactly one zone.)

This suggests the following question: 
> What "zone" is traffic "in" after it enters a firewall's interface in one zone, but before it exit's another interface of the same firewall?  

The answer is that the firewall's internal data-plane is an implicit "transit zone" in that case, as illustrated in the following digram:

### The multi-VRF implicit transit zone
The preceding diagram illustrates firewalls in which a single routing function exists (all interfaces are in a single routing domain.) In many cases, not only are per-zone policy/rule-bases present on such firewalls, but often per-zone virtual routers are present as well.  That scenario is illustrated here:
