summary: "Graphs are 'everywhere', let's see what the network we're describing looks like as a graph"

In order to generalize the issue(s?) at play here, we further formalize our model.  We will start by mapping the elements of our architecture to a formalized  undirectedgraph".  

# The reference topology
The two figures below (also present in the parent page) illustrate a network with four network security zones (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), and four "sites" (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).  Site "0" represents a wide-area-network, and sites 0.1-0.3 represent separate metropolitan areas.  Zone "0" represents the "transit zone", and zones 0.1-0.3 represent separate workload-hosting zones.  This topology is depicted with isometric figures in order to help visualize the intersections of sites and security-zones .  In the first figure, "horizontal planes" contain all the nodes with a shared "site-ID" value, and "vertical columns" contain all the nodes with a shared "security-zone" value.  (Horizontal and vertical are reversed in the second figure)

These two figure illustrate visually that "site" and "security zone" are treated *almost* identically in this framework.  We see the *mostly* the same  patterns visible when "zones" and "sites" are visually inverted.  The *differences* that we observe include:
- Zone-0 differs from the other three zones
  - *No* stateful nodes exist *in* zone-0
  - *Only* stateful nodes connect *to* nodes in zone-0
- Site-0 differs from the other three sites
  - No stateful nodes exist in site-0
- Zone-0 differs from Site-0
  - Nodes in zone-0 form a tree with the zone-0/site-0 node at its root
  - There are *no* connections between two nodes in site-0

# Modeling the network topology as a graph

## Elements

The BGP-speakers on our network are represented as "nodes" on an un-directed graph, and the links between them (transport+eBGP-session) are "edges" on the same graph.  (The graph is "undirected" in that there is no "directionality" to the edges.)

## Properties

* "Statefulness" is a boolean value that describes whether or not a node tracks/enforces connection state for bi-directional traffic flows between two nodes.  Put more plainly: "whether the node will refuse to forward traffic if it does not "see" *both* flows in a bidirectional flow-pair between two other nodes.
  * This will be important later, when we start building paths through the graph
  * We depict statefulness in the visual graph by depicting the node with a dashed perimeter (non-stateful nodes have a solid perimeter)
* "Security-zone" is a label/tag used to identify nodes which may communicate with each other *without* passing through a "stateful" node.
  * That is to say, that any path between two nodes in different security zones (with different zone-ID values/colors) *must* include at least one stateful node
    * 
  * We depict the security-zone of a node by coloring the node's perimeter  (each unique color is a distinct security zone)
* "Site" a much fuzzier concept
  * Our real-world application uses the "site" abstraction as a convenient label for devices that are all located within sufficient proximity of each other for a pair of firewalls to operate in a highly-available manner
  * That is to say, we care about "site", because it gives us a convenient way to describe devices that are "close enough" too each other for a specific purpose
  * This is arguably more a property of the "edge" connecting two nodes than of the nodes themselves
    * As such, we will signify "site" on our graph by assigning a "weight" of "1.1" to edges connecting nodes in the same "site" and a weight of "1" edges connecting nodes in different sites.


## Graphs of the topology

The figures below use the conventions in the immediately preceding section to illustrate a graph of the network topology illustrated in the initial section of this page.  The first figure mirrors the spatial relationship between elements on the original diagram.  The second figure depicts the same graph, visualized as three pseudo-trees with the non-zero security zone / zero-site nodes as their roots.  The third depicts the graph as a tree with the site-0/zone-3 node as its root. (The site and zone labels on each node are preserved in this figures for ease of reference to the original reference topology.)

## Observation: Recursion of "zones" and "sites"

It is apparrent from the visual depiction of the graphs that the "transit zone "zone-0" has a parent/child relationship with the "workload-hosting" zones (zones 0.1 - 0.3) and that the "WAN site" (site "0") has a parent/child relationship with the "workload-hosting" sites (sites 0.1 - 0.3)  What, if anything does this suggest about recursively defined sites and/or zones?  Would there be an value in such constructs in the first place?

### Recursive/nested sites structure

As previously discussed, the concept of "site"is useful to us in this context specifically because of the functional limitations of firewalls and other devices acting as "stateful" nodes on the network/graph. We want the selected paths through the graph/network to be "aware" of whether stateful nodes are in the same site or not.  Recursively defined sites, or "sub-sites" are not germane to the use-cases we contemplate here, but *how* they *would* be structured if a relevant use-case presented itself is worth considering.

In order to allow us to represent disjoint nteworks, we will use "0" as am implicit root-level of the site hierarchy (with a single, implicit, node.)  We will use the following convention in applying site-labels to edges connecting nodes:
- (Implicit) edges from the implicit root node (to "actual" top-level sites' nodes) are labeled as
  - 0.0 If the non-root node has no "children"  (where "*n*" is the top level site)
  - 0.*n* If the non-root-node has "children" (sub-sites), where the non-root-node is the *nth* isolated group of non-root-nodes
- Edges between nodes at the same "site" (at any level) are labelled with the label of site's connection to the parent-site

 - 
Within the graph, we would assign a weight of "1.1.1" to any edges that connect to nodes within the same "sub-site".  This pattern could be extended to an arbitrary degree of recursion (if there were a use-case to take advantage of it.)

The following figure depicts a topology with the "root" site ("0") having three child-sites ("0.1" - "0.3"), each of which have three sub-site/children ("0.*n*.1 - 0.*n*.3"), which in turn, have their own child/sub-sub-sites ("0.*n*.*m*.1 - 0.*n*.*m*.3")   The recursive nature of the sub-site structure is illustrated with dashed circles around each "site", with each parent-level site containing all of each children-sites (and their descendents.)

### Recursive security zones

Security zones might also be nested nested using a similar mechanism, although in this case the distinction between child/parent object has a deeper policy significance in the real-world networks that we are modelling.  If we entertain the concept of recursively structured network security zones, it becomes quickly apparent that there is a parent-child relationship between "transit zone" and "workload-hosting zone", and that the a workload-hosting-zone with "child" sub-zones *is* the transit-zone for it child/sub-zones.  As illustrated in the following figures:



## Rules of Inference

We use the following rules of inference in building our graph (network topology):

  - All nodes have a "site-ID" and "zone-ID" property
  - Non-stateful nodes can only be connected to:
        - condition-1
            - Other non-stateful nodes with the same "zone-ID" property
          - or
            - Stateful nodes
      - and
        - condition-2
          - Nodes with the same site-ID value
        - or
          - Nodes with a site-ID value of "0"
  - Nodes can only be connected to:



# Miscellania

We can regard the network topologies described in the previous section as an undirected graph ( "G" ) , with the BGP-speaking routers/firewalls as nodes/vertices and the BGP sessions between them as edges.  The simplest-case is depicted below:

We can regard the selected path between an *ordered* pair ("P1") of nodes/vertices ("a,b") as a directed-graph ( "DG (P1)"  ) derived from "G".

We can regard the path selected for the *inversion* of ordered-pair "P1"  ()

We need a path-selection algorithm the will:
    - Result in selected paths for any two 

We can *describe* those paths based on the following properties:
- Source properties
  - The security-zone-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The site-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Destination properties
  - The security-zone-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The site-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- In which site-ID(s) the packet traverses the transit-zone
-
