summary: "A change to the actual topology"
---

This framework relies heavily on the concept of a transit-zone.  That is, a (network security) zone which is tasked exclusively with providing transport for traffic between other zones.  No workload/hosts are attached to this network, only transport nodes.  The "edge"/"perimeter" of this zone is its connection to the firewalls on the perimeter of all the other zones.

### Illustration

In the following diagram, a "transit" zone is added to the topology of case study design.


### Key elements of the framework

- A generalized algorithm for path selection that results in symmetric paths between endpoints with ECMP paths between them.
-  A formalized transit-zone.
- Route-tagging (with BGP large-community strings)
-
