summary: "Graphs are 'everywhere', let's see what the network we're describing looks like as a graph"
---

In order to generalize the issue(s?) at play here, we further formalize our model in a graph-theory framework.  We will start by mapping the elements of our architecture to a formalized  undirectedgraph".  

# The reference topology

The two figures below (also present in the parent page) illustrate a network with four network security zones (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), and four "sites" (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).  Site "0" represents a wide-area-network, and sites 0.1-0.3 represent separate metropolitan areas.  Zone "0" represents the "transit zone", and zones 0.1-0.3 represent separate workload-hosting zones.  This topology is depicted with isometric figures in order to help visualize the intersections of sites and security-zones .  In the first figure, "horizontal planes" contain all the nodes with a shared "site-ID" value, and "vertical columns" contain all the nodes with a shared "security-zone" value.  (Horizontal and vertical are reversed in the second figure)

These two figures illustrate visually that "site" and "security zone" function similarly in the topology we're analyzing.  We see *similar* visual patterns when "zones" and "sites" are inverted in the two graphs.  The *differences* that we observe include:

- Zone-0 differs from the other three zones
  - *No* stateful nodes exist *in* zone-0
  - *Only* stateful nodes connect *to* nodes in zone-0
- Site-0 differs from the other three sites
  - No stateful nodes exist in site-0
- Zone-0 differs from Site-0
  - Nodes in zone-0 form a tree with the zone-0/site-0 node at its root
  - There are *no* connections between two nodes in site-0

Up to this point we have left "site" and "zone" very loosely defined.  Before we proceed with mapping the topology above to a graph, we will define those two terms.

## Network Security Zones

We define "network security zone" as a group of nodes on the network that are able to communicate without traversing a firewall.  As discussed in the preamble, this "matters" because firewalls enforce statefulness in the traffic that they forward.  For two nodes to successfully communicate with each other, messages/traffic in *both* directions (A to B, and B to A) must traverse the *same* firewalls.  If a firewall only sees half of the traffic, it will detect that statefulness has not been propertly maintained and discard the traffic.

## Sites

We define "site" as a group of nodes on the network are are within the same metropolitan area as each other.  As discussed in the preamble, this is a relatively arbitrary distinction, and one that largely boils down to nodes that are "close enough" that we prefer traffic between nodes stay within that "site."

# Modeling the network topology as a graph

## Elements

The BGP-speakers on our network are represented as "nodes" on an un-directed graph, and the links between them (transport+eBGP-session) are "edges" on the same graph.  (The graph is "undirected" in that there is no "directionality" to the edges.)

## Properties

- "Statefulness" is a boolean value that describes whether or not a node tracks/enforces connection state for bi-directional traffic flows between two nodes.  Put more plainly: "whether the node will refuse to forward traffic if it does not "see" *both* flows in a bidirectional flow-pair between two other nodes.
  - This will be important later, when we start building *paths* through the graph
  - We depict statefulness in the visual graph by depicting the node with a dashed perimeter (non-stateful nodes have a solid perimeter)
- "Security-zone" is a label/tag used to identify nodes which may communicate with each other *without* passing through a "stateful" node.
  - That is to say, that any path between two nodes in different security zones (with different zone-ID values/colors) *must* include at least one stateful node
    *Conversely, there must be a path between nodes in the same security zone that does *not* traverse any stateful nodes
  - We depict the security-zone of a node by coloring the node's perimeter  (each unique color is a distinct security zone)
- "Site" is a property of the links between devices on the network
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in the same site with a label ending in ".0"
    - All edges between nodes in the *same* site will have will have identical labels
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in different sites with a label ending in ".*n*" (where *n* is a non-zero integer)

## Graphs of the topology

The figure below is a translation of the figure at the top of this page to a graph, using the conventions described in the preceding section.

The two figures below show the same graph, with the elements' visual orentation shifted, but no changes to the underlying structure of the graph itself.

[![image](./grphth-12.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-12.svg){:target="_blank"}

The preceding figures illustrate the following observation of our network/graph's structure:
> For every "non-zero" site value "*n*", a stateful site *n* node is connected to a stateless site *0* node, and a stateless site *n* node is connected to a statefu site *0* node.

## Rules of Inference

We use the following rules of inference in building our graph (network topology):

* A node may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * Each node is characterized as either "statefu" (dashed line) or "stateless" (solid line)
  * Each node is characterized with a single security zone (a unique color per security zone on the graph)
* Edges may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * A path that does *not* include a stateful node *must* exist between all stateless nodes with the same security-zone property
  * An edge between two different security zones *must* connect to stateful nodes
    * Unless the node has the a value of "0" for its security-zone property, in which case the node with zone property of "0" may be stateless
* Edges are labeled using the following conventions
  * Connections between edges in the same "site" end in ".0"
  * Connections between edges in different "sites" end in ".*n*" where "*n*" is a non-zero integer.
