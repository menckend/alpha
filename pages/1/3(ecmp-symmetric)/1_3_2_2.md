summary: "In which we attempt to solve for *everything*"
---

In this section, we will extrapolate a path-selection mechanism that addresses the previously discussed challenge of unpredictably asymmetric paths for flows with endpoints in different security zones and sites from each other.  As previously discussed, the generalized challenge is that:

> For every packet traversing both a security zone border *and* a site border (from s*X*z*N* to s*Y*z*M*), there will be equal-cost paths present for the destination.  Packets with reversed source and destinations (from S*Y*z*M* to s*X*s*N*) will also match multiple equal-cost paths to their destination.  (These paths will be reversed versions of the equal-cost paths of the original packet.)    This will result in asymmetric pathing that causes packets in the same "session" to traverse different firewall instances, which will cause the firewalls to drop the packets as out-of-state.

Also as previously discussed:

> This challenge occurs when multiple network security zones are extended between sites, with zone-perimeter firewalls present at multiple sites.

We will extrapolate our path-selection mechanism by:

- Identifying the potential paths between workload-hosting zone instances in several different topology iterations
- Identifying salient descriptors of the paths between workload-hosting zone instances in sites
- Describing all of the potential paths using the salient descriptors
- Identifying and prioritizing desired characteristics of path selection
- ...?
