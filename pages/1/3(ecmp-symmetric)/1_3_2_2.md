In this section, we will extrapolate a path-selection algorithm that addresses the previously discussed challenge of unpredictably asymmetric paths for flows with endpoints in different security zones and sites from each other.  As previously discussed, the generalized problem statement is:

>For every packet traversing both a security zone border and a site border, there will be ECMP routes present for the destination at both the originating-VRF of the packet and at the zone-0 VRF of the site at which the packet originated.  This will result in asymmetric pathing that causes packets in the same flow to traverse different firewall instances, which will cause the firewalls to drop the packets as out-of-state.

We will use the following topology as a starting point for our analaysis:

## Initial Analysis

In order for flows to succeed they must traverse the same *stateful* hops in each direction.  If we are to solve this using routing policy, we'll need to describe the potential paths in terms of those stateful hops.

And, because we're concerned with symmetry, we'll need to find a way of parsing those descriptions that creates the same results when evaluated "forwards" and "backwards."  Given that a flow consists of packets moving in both direcitons between two endpoints (A and B). Our algorithm will need to yield paths with the same stateful hops for both the A->B and B->A directions.  

We can *characterize* those paths based on the following properties:
- Source properties
  - The security-zone-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The site-ID (as a numeric value) in which the packet's source is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Destination properties
  - The security-zone-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The site-ID in which the packet's destination is located
  - The number of stateful-hops in the packet's destination-site
- Whether the path traverses the transit-zone in site-0 (the WAN.)

That group of properties *is* sufficient for us to construct path-selection rules that yield a symmetric path.  Consider the following.
- We can classify any packet as "low-to-high" or "high-to-low" with regards to both security-zone-ID and site-ID.
  - Having assigned a (n arbitrary) numerical index to each security-zone and each site
  - In a given flow, if A->B is "low-to-high", we know that B->A will be "high-to-low"
    - That is, a comparison will yield "opposite" results for A->B and B->A directions of a given flow
- The topology that we have dictated ensures that for any inter-site/inter-zone flow, the available equal-cost paths will have the following distribution of stateful hops
  - Both firewalls in the "A" side (call it "path-1")
  - Both firewalls in the "B" side (call it "path-2")
  - One firewall in both the "A" side and the "B" side (call it "path-3")

We established previously that we prefer to *not* have a flow traverse firewalls at both sites, which leaves us in need of a decision procedure that will select either path-1 or path-2 when executed on *both* the A->B and B->A directions of a flow.

There are *two* key insights that we can combine to achieve this objective:

> The question "is the source or destination-zone 'higher'" will always have the opposite answers for "A->B" and "B->A" packets.

> "The path with more stateful hops in the *destination* site" for "A->B" packets will always be the same as "the path with more stateful hops in the *source" site" for "B->A" packets

With those two givens, the basics of our policy for modifying eBGP path selection in the case of ECMPs emerges:

> On routers with non-zero site-IDs (physical sites; not the WAN) and zero security-zone IDs (the transit zone) always prefer next-hops with a non-zero zone ID to next-hops with a zone-ID of zero.

> Always prefer the path with more stateful hops in the site of the higher security zone.
