summary: "In which we make things look different"
---

In order to generalize the issue(s?) at play here, we formalize our model in a graph-theory oriented framework.

# The reference topology

The two figures below (also present in the parent page) illustrate a network with four network security zones (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), and four "sites" (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).  Site "0" represents a wide-area-network, and sites 0.1-0.3 represent separate metropolitan areas.  Zone "0" represents a "transit zone" for zones 0.1-0.3 (which represent separate workload-hosting zones).  

This topology is depicted with isometric figures in order to help visualize the intersections of sites and security-zones .  In the first figure, "horizontal planes" contain all the nodes with a shared "site-ID" value, and "vertical columns" contain all the nodes with a shared "security-zone" value.  (Horizontal and vertical are reversed in the second figure)

These two figures illustrate visually that "site" and "security zone" function similarly in the topology we're analyzing.  We see *similar* visual patterns when "zones" and "sites" are inverted in the two graphs.  The *differences* that we observe include:

- Zone-0 differs from the other three zones
  - *No* stateful nodes exist *in* zone-0
  - *Only* stateful nodes connect *to* nodes in zone-0
- Site-0 differs from the other three sites
  - No stateful nodes exist in site-0
- Zone-0 differs from Site-0
  - Nodes in zone-0 form a tree with the zone-0/site-0 node at its root
  - There are *no* connections between two nodes in site-0

Up to this point we have left "site" and "zone" very loosely defined.  We will formalize them in subsequent sections, but for now, we will integrate them to the graph as properties of the edges and nodes.

#  Where are all the endpoints/workloads/hosts?

At this point, we'll finally acknowledge a non-trivial simplification that has been implicit in all of the topologies previously discussed.  We have not included any "workload" (aka "non-forwarding"; aka "end-point", aka "host' etc.. ) nodes in our topologies.  The only nodes that we've depicted have been "forwarding" (aka "transport") nodes.   The motivation for this omission is a straight-forward desire to reduce visual clutter in the diagrams and conceptual clutter in the model itself.  

In the "actual" networks that these topologies represent, those non-depicted (non-forwarding, "workload") nodes on the network/graph are "on" subnets that are originated into BGP by the nodes that *are* represented on the topology-diagram and graph.  When we begin discussing BGP advertisements and propagation, we will use a unique label for each node as a stand-in for all networks that the BGP router that it represents would originate in an "actual" network.

# Modeling the network topology as a graph

We will use an undirected graph consisting of nodes and edges.

## Elements

The routers/transport-nodes/BGP-speakers on our network are represented as "nodes" on the graph, and the links between them are "edges" depicted as edges on the same graph.  Each edge is representative of 

## Properties

- "Statefulness" is a boolean value that describes whether or not a node tracks/enforces connection state for bi-directional traffic flows between two nodes.  Put more plainly: "whether the node will refuse to forward traffic if it does not "see" *both* flows in a bidirectional flow-pair between two other nodes.
  - This will be important later, when we start building *paths* through the graph
  - We depict statefulness in the visual graph by depicting the node with a dashed perimeter (non-stateful nodes have a solid perimeter)
- "Security-zone" is a label/tag used to identify nodes which may communicate with each other *without* passing through a "stateful" node.
  - That is to say, that any path between two nodes in different security zones (with different zone-ID values/colors) *must* include at least one stateful node
    *Conversely, there must be a path between nodes in the same security zone that does *not* traverse any stateful nodes
  - We depict the security-zone of a node by coloring the node's perimeter  (each unique color is a distinct security zone)
- "Site" is a property of the links between devices on the network
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in the same site with a label ending in ".0"
    - All edges between nodes in the *same* site will have will have identical labels
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in different sites with a label ending in ".*n*" (where *n* is a non-zero integer)

## Graphs of the topology

The figure below is a translation of the figure at the top of this page to a graph, using the conventions described in the preceding section.

[![image](./grphth-11.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-11.svg){:target="_blank"}

The two figures below show the same graph, with the elements' visual orentation shifted, but no changes to the underlying structure of the graph itself.

[![image](./grphth-12.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-12.svg){:target="_blank"}

The preceding figures illustrate the following observation of our network/graph's structure:
> For every "non-zero" site value "*n*", a stateful site *n* node is connected to a stateless site *0* node, and a stateless site *n* node is connected to a statefu site *0* node.

## Rules of Inference

We use the following rules of inference in building our graph (network topology):

* A node may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * Each node is characterized as either "statefu" (dashed line) or "stateless" (solid line)
  * Each node is characterized with a single security zone (a unique color per security zone on the graph)
* Edges may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * A path that does *not* include a stateful node *must* exist between all stateless nodes with the same security-zone property
  * An edge between two different security zones *must* connect to stateful nodes
    * Unless the node has the a value of "0" for its security-zone property, in which case the node with zone property of "0" may be stateless
* Edges are labeled using the following conventions
  * Connections between edges in the same "site" end in ".0"
  * Connections between edges in different "sites" end in ".*n*" where "*n*" is a non-zero integer.


## Generalization

Let's revisit how "site", "zone", and "statefulness" properties related to each other and see if it can be further generalized:

* Site (a property of edges): 
  * Will influence *preferred* paths through the graph.
    * With no preference for bidrectional symmetry of the path
* Zone and statefulness (properties of nodes)
  * Will influence *permitted paths through the graph
  * With paths traversing "stateful" nodes requiring bidrectional symetry
