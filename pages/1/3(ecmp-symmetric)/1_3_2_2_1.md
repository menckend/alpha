A primary focus of our analsysis will be whether an effective/managable policy framework for symmetric pathing is viable for all, some, or none of the designs/topologies we have contemplated up to this point.  In this page, we will formalize those design options and enumerate the expected BGP RIF/FIB behavior for each.

## Design options

Our analysis will consider multiple permutations of the following design-options/patterns:

### Pattern 1

This option utilizes per site / per-workload-zone firewall instances and has the following elements:

- Workload-zone VRFs and transit-zone VRFs are instantiated on each site's network infrastructure and are extended between sites
  - Transit-zone is extended to *all* sites
  - Workload-zones are only extended to sites if hosted-work is present at that site/zone
- A firewall is instantiated when a specific workload-hosting zone has workload present at a specific site
- Each FW has one interface in a site's transit-zone and one in a workload-hosting zone at the same site
- Each firewall has a unique BGP AS and is an eBGP peer with the site's transit VRF and the site's workload-VRF (of the zone it is "attached" to)
- All inter-zone routing within a site is performed by the site's L3-network infrastructure's transit-zone VRF

> This pattern is topologically identical to a similar pattern in which monolithic firewalls are implemented, but are configured with per-workload-zone VRFs (with unique ASNs) and with no internal transit-VRF or route-leaking between them.  The result is Layer-3 isolated, per-zone paths through the firewalls.

### Option 2

This option utilizes per-site (monolithic) firewall instances with a single routing function and has the following elements:

- Workload-zone VRFs are instantiated on each site's network infrastructure and are extended between sites
- The transit-zone VRF is implemented on the WAN-site only and extended directly to a transit-zone interface on each site's firewall
- FWs have interfaces on the "transit zone" (peered directly to the WAN VRF)
- FWs have interfaces in multiple "workload-hosting zones" (instantiated as isolated VRFs in the site's network infrastructure)
- An interface in a specific workload-hosting zone is instantiated on the firewall *only* if workload is present/hosted in that zone at that site
- The firewall routes traffic between its interfaces, acting as a single BPG AS.

### Option 3










2. Per-site/monolithic firewalls  with per-zone VRFs, per-zone BGP ASes, and peering between those per-zone-ASes









We will consider topologies with permutations of the following design elements:
- Firewall instantiation/rules-of-inference
  - A single (HA pair or cluster) monolithic/multi-zone firewall per-site pattern
  - A single (HA pair or cluster) firewall per-site/per-zone pattern
- Inter-zone routing pattern
  - The (monolithic) firewall routes traffic directly between zones with*out* a BGP "hop" along the way  (single-VRF firewall)
  - The (monolithic) firewall routes traffic directly between zones *with* a BGP "hop" along the way (multi-VRF/internal-transit-zone firewall)
  - The firewall *only* routes traffic between the transit-zone and attached workload-zone.


In the first, firewalls are instantiated per-zone, and traffic between zones is routed on an explicitly instantiated transit-zone routing function.

In the preceding diagram, two workload-hosting network security zones have been deployed at each of two sites.  Each of those zones is extended between sites across the WAN.  In addition, a "transit zone" has been extended across the WAN between the two sites.

The three best (and equal cost) paths between site-1/zone-2 and site-2/zone-3 are illustrated above, and the AS-path of each of those paths is listed in the boxes at the bottom.

In the second topology, monolithic multizone per-site firewalls are deployed and are capable of routing traffic directly between zones

## Initial Analysis

In the first  topology, inter-site/inter-zone flows traverse three equal-cost paths in both ("A-to-B" and "B-to-A") directions.
- Path "A" traverses the zone-2 FW and zone-3 FW in site-2  (and no firewalls in site-1)
- Path "B" traverses the zone-2 FW and zone-3 FW in site-1  (and no firewalls in site-2)
- Path "C" traverses the zone-2 FW in site-1 and the zone-3 F in site-2

Paths A and B both traverse firewalls at one site only, while path C traverses firewalls at both sites 1 and 2.  From an optimization perspective, path C is marginally preferable to paths A and B because it splits the firewall capacity consumption across the two sites.

In the second topology, there are only two equal-cost paths.  Path A traverses the site-1 firewall and path b traverses the site 2 firewall.  From an optimizaiton perspective, nothing recommends one path over the other.
