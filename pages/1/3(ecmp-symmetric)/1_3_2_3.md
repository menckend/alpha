## 'Site' propery becomes "path affinity group" ("PAG") property

We initially described a "site" as a group of nodes on the network that are within the same metropolitan area as each other.  As discussed in the preamble, this is a relatively arbitrary distinction, and one that largely boils down to nodes that are "close enough" that we prefer traffic between them stay within that "site."  From a *network* perspective though, what actually *matters* is the latency of the link (edge) connecting the nodes.  In our collective practical experience, there *is* a direct relationship between distance and latency, but ultimately the latency of the transit path is the characteristic that *matters*. That is why we subseuqently  defined "site" as a property of *edges* rather than a property of *nodes*.

### How "site" was relevant to the scenario in this article's preamble
The concept of "site", in the scenario described in the preamble of this article, captured more than one characteristic of the real-world properties that it carried into the ntework architecture.  It also quantized those properties in a convenient (if not immediately apparent) manner.

#### Link (edge) latency
As described in the initial paragraph of this page, all of the nodes in the same real-world physical location (metropolitan area) were classified as being part of the same "site."  This was roughly equivalent to <3ms of latency on the links between any two nodes in that same site.  The enterprise in question wasn't concerned with whether a potential path between two nodes was 1.5ms or 2.3ms when selecting which paths to use; and the "site" implicitly quantized all values between 0 and 3ms in a single "site value."

#### Failure domains
Each "site" as used here also provided an implicit (and highly desirable) separation of failure-domains for a multitude of failure-modes/loss-scenarios.
















However, instead of providing a quantitative measurement of latency, it instead collapses the entire range of possible values into two options ("WAN" or "better than WAN.")  This is analagous to the common practice of assigning equal treatment to a *range* of values for use in path selection (in link-state routing protocols, for instance.)  

If we stipulate that "site" in the networks we are contemplating is:
> A region in space (or the set of network nodes *in* that space) for which we "prefer" paths between nodes "in" that site to remain local-to.

... that gives us a useful construct to address the the "real world" network design incentives to avoid un-needed high-latency hops between network nodes.  It's worth considering, though: 

> *are* there *other* properties of nodes (or the edges connecting them) that we might want to express a "locality" preference for?  Are those properties inherently recursive in structure?  Is there value to modeling that hierarchical structure in our graph?

Distance/locality *can*, obviously, be sub-divided in a hierarchical manner.   "Degree of resiliency" is another property that we *might* want to take into consideration when selecting paths cross the network/graph; it does *not* suggest an obviously recursive structure, but the related topic of failure domains *does*.  So, the mechanism we're using for expressing the "site"/distance/latency property of an edge might be adaptable to additional properties (some of which may be structured hierarchically) and the real-world phenomena of site/distance/latency definitely *can* be structured hierarchically.

Rather than "site", we will use the name "path affinity " for this property of the edges in our graph.

Two key questions suggest themselves at this point:
> How would we recurse the "path affinity group" model, if we wanted to.  And (of course) *do* we want to?

##  Hierarchical relationship of PAG "0" to other PAG instances

The topology that we've described up to this point used a distinctly hierarchical model for "site" (now path-affinity group), which it inherits from the real-world topology our model is describing.  Each of our "workload-hosting" PAGs requires at least one connection to the WAN PAG.

That is why we used "0" as the value for the (parent) "WAN" path-affinity-group", and "0.*n*" as the value for the (child) "workload hosting" PAGs.  The value represents a "stack" of both the parent's identifier ("0") and the child's identifier ("n").   We now further specify that edges connecting two nodes in PAG 0.*n* are labeled as "0.*n*.0".  This lets us indicate with the edge's label, whether it is connected to two nodes in the same PAG, or to two nodes in different PAGs, *and* which PAGs the nodes are "located in" (are "part of").

That structure is trivially extensible if we want to recursively create further subdivisions of the network/graph.  If, for instance, our "workload" PAGs consisted of multiple "buildings" in a single metro region, we might prefer to have traffic stay local to a building, when possible, rather than bounce between buildings.  (But, that preference might be 10x or 100x less significant than the distinction between "WAN" and site.)  Likewise, if a given site had a workload cluster with its own overlay-network with routing gateways "connecting" it to the underlay network, similar dynamics could apply.

### Integral PAG Depth (IPD)

> We will use the term **"integral PAG depth"** (IPD) to refer to the number parent/child relationships that exist between a node and the top/root level of the PAG hierarchy.  The "WAN" node (PAG 0) contemplated above has an integral PAG  depth (IPD) of "0"; "metro region PAGs" have an IPD of "1", and "building" PAGs have an IPD of "2."  
> "Integral" here is an allusion to the fact that the number of edges with labels ending with a non-zero-integer on the shortest path from any given node to a node in the bottom/root-level of the PAG-hierarchy tell us how *deep* the given node sits in the PAG hierarchy.

## Creating recursive Path-affinity-group structures in the graph

In the *WAN > site > building* hierarchy described above, the original (WAN > site) hierarchy is extended by one additional level.  The relation of "WAN" to "site" is the same as that of "site" to "building."  We will extend the labeling convention for the "site" property of edges by appending an additional "section" to the label (representing the "building" identifier, if there is one.)

The following figure depicts a modified version of the reference topology graph, incorporating *two* additional layers of recursion in the "site" property.  Site "0.1" (IED=1) is "split" into two sub-sites (0.1.1 and 0.1.2, each with IED=2), one of which (0.1.1) is further divided into two sub-sub-sites (0.1.1.1 and 0.1.1.2, each with IEDs of 3.)

The preceding figure also illustrates a new rule of inference for edges.  Specifically:

> Edges can only connect two nodes at the *same* layer of the site hierarchy or in immediately adjacent layers of the site hierarchy

That rule only "makes sense" if the "site hierarchy" really *is* strictly hierarchical. It's certainly easy to imagine scenarios in which "site" (or any other property we want to model this way) might be strictly hiearchical, or might be much "looser" (allowing edges between nodes in non-neighboring levels of the site hierarchy.)

### Better Illustrating the Recursion

The following figure presents an alternate arrangement of the same graph, which more intuitively illustrates the recursive nature of its the site hierarchy.

## Refining the PAG property

PAG property values provide a unique identifier for each branch of the site hierarchy, as well as an indicator of whether an edge is present in one, or in two different levels PAG hierarchy.

These are the rules we will follow in constructing the PAG values for our graphs
- We introduce an "implicit"/non-extant "PAG root" *node* to each graph, representing the root of the PAG tree/hierarchy
  - We introduce this "implicit" PAG root in order to allow our graph to represent fully *disjoint* networks
- We introduce "implicit"/non-extant "PAG root" *edges* to each graph, representing the parent/child relationship between the PAG-root, and nodes that it shares edges with
  - Each of these implicit egdges (and the attached nodes) represents a completely disjoint PAG hierarchy (hence, a completely disjoint graph/network)
  - These *implicit* edges are *not* eligible for use in paths across the graph
- Nodes that are connected to (share an implicit edge with) the implicit "PAG root" node are assigned a PAG value of "0.*n*", where *n* is an index value of such nodes.
  - They are regarded as having an integral path depth (IPD) of 1.
- Nodes that are attached to nodes with an IPD of 1 and are *not* attached to the implicit root node 



- Each edge property value is expressed as a decimal-point delimited sequence of octets in decimal notation.
  - E.g.:  "0.*n.n.n*.0", or "0.*n*"  (where "n"s are non-zero integers )
- The first octet is always "0", representing the nominal/implicit "root" of the SP zone hierarchy.
- Subsequent octets represent child/branch layers of the PAG hierarchy.
  - A non-zero integer value in these octets represents a distinct "branch" in the PAG tree, with no shared edges.
  - A zero value in any octet (other than the initial/root octet) represents 

- Labels are formatted as decimal-point delimited decimal octets, each beginning with "0."
- Each non-zero octet (read left-to-right) represents a level of the site hierarchy
  - E.g.:  In "0.n.m.0", the first "0" represents the implicit root of the site hierarchy, and
    - "n" represents an instance of the graph-local "top"/root level of the site hierarchy (the WAN, in this exercise)
    - "m" represents an instance of the graph-local 2nd-level of the site hierarchy  (one of three workload-hosting sites, in this exercise.)
-  

- All edge labels begin with "0."  ()

> At this point, we will adjust our model and begin treating the path-affinity-group (PAG)property as a property of the nodes in our graph, rather then a property of the edges.   The reasons for doing so relate to the fact that what we are modeling in our graph is the behavior of a network of eBGP routers, and the nuances that we want to capture are going to end up being expressed as properties of the nodes themselves in BGP updates.

>Nope -- don't do that (^).  Keep the PAG property as a property of the edges, where it belongs.  Establish a mechanism for establishing a "derived PAG value" for nodes  (but it's still ultimately a function of their edges.
