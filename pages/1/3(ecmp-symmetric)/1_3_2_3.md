In order to generalize the issue(s?) at play here, we formalize our model in a graph-theory oriented framework.

# The reference topology

The two figures below (also present in the parent page) illustrate a network with four network security zones (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4), and four "sites" (0, 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3).  Site "0" represents a wide-area-network, and sites 0.1-0.3 represent separate metropolitan areas.  Zone "0" represents the "transit zone", and zones 0.1-0.3 represent separate workload-hosting zones.  This topology is depicted with isometric figures in order to help visualize the intersections of sites and security-zones .  In the first figure, "horizontal planes" contain all the nodes with a shared "site-ID" value, and "vertical columns" contain all the nodes with a shared "security-zone" value.  (Horizontal and vertical are reversed in the second figure)

These two figures illustrate visually that "site" and "security zone" function similarly in the topology we're analyzing.  We see *similar* visual patterns when "zones" and "sites" are inverted in the two graphs.  The *differences* that we observe include:

- Zone-0 differs from the other three zones
  - *No* stateful nodes exist *in* zone-0
  - *Only* stateful nodes connect *to* nodes in zone-0
- Site-0 differs from the other three sites
  - No stateful nodes exist in site-0
- Zone-0 differs from Site-0
  - Nodes in zone-0 form a tree with the zone-0/site-0 node at its root
  - There are *no* connections between two nodes in site-0

Up to this point we have left "site" and "zone" very loosely defined.  We'll begin by abstracting and formalizing them both.

## Zones

### Network Security Zones

A widely adopted working-definition of "network security zone" is a group of nodes on a network that are able to communicate without traversing a secured perimeter.  As discussed in the preamble, that "securd perimeter" is typically a network firewall, and this *matters* because network firewalls enforce statefulness in the traffic that they forward.  

If two nodes ("A" and "B") on the network in different network security zones attempt to establish a TCP session with each other, network firewalls that are in-path for that flow *will* validate the state data of each TCP segment and refuse to forward traffic for which it perceives the TCP state to be invalid.  Validating state in this manner requires that the validator see *all* messages in the TCP session  (B->A messages and B->A traffic).

If the paths that the network selects for B->A flows and A->B flows don't include the *same* set of network firewalls, the aforementioned connections between them will fail.

### The Chicken or the Egg

Before we abstract and generalize *too* much, it's important to consider whether we consider the "nature" of a network security zone.  

From an *information-security* perspective, the essence of a network security zone is the mitigation and partitioning of risk at specific (secured perimeter) nodes.  From this persepctive, it is natural/reasonable to consider a network security zone's defining element as the shared characteristics of the (non-perimeter) nodes that are located "in" that zone.

From a *networking* perspective, the essence of a network security zone is the path-selection requirements that it introduces.

### Generalizing to "symmetric ingress/egress zones"

Put as directly as possible, the network design requirement introduced by the presence of state-enforcing nodes is:

> For any *selected* path starting at node "A" and ending at node "B" that includes a "state-enforcing" node ("C"), the *selected* path starting at node "B" and ending at node "A" must *also* include node "C"

Note that the requirement is not for *fully* symmetric bidirectional paths between nodes A and B, just that if a state-enforcing node "C" is present in the A->B path, that node "C" be present in the B->A path.

We can describe a network security zone as any nodes between which there is a path that includes *no* state-enforcing nodes.  We can also describe it as a group of nodes which *must* a state-enforcing node when reaching nodes not in the group.

In the preceding section, we explained how and why network firewalls introduce these path selection requirements.  They are not the *only* type of devices that perform stateful enforcement though, and there are other use-cases beyond state enforcement that present the same requirement.

At this point, we will generalize from the term "state-enforcing" to the term "inverse path presence required"  (IPPR).  The term is a relative mouthful, compared to "state enforcing", but makes room for other design challenges with the same requirement.

We will also generalize from "network-security zone" to  "symmetric ingress/egress zone" (for the same reason.)

## Sites

We define "site" as a group of nodes on the network are are within the same metropolitan area as each other.  As discussed in the preamble, this is a relatively arbitrary distinction, and one that largely boils down to nodes that are "close enough" that we prefer traffic between nodes stay within that "site."


# Modeling the network topology as a graph


##  Where are all the endpoints/workloads/hosts?

At this point, we'll finally acknowledge a non-trivial simplification that has been implicit in all of the topologies discussed up to now.  We have not included any "workload" (aka "non-forwarding"; aka "end-point", aka "host' etc.. ) nodes in our topologies.   The motivation for this omission is a straight-forward desire to reduce visual clutter in the diagrams.  In the "actual" networks that these topologies represent, those nodes on the network/graph are "on" subnets that are originated into BGP by the nodes that *are* represented on the topology-diagram and graph.  When we begin discussing BGP advertisements and propagation, we will use a unique label for each node as a stand-in for all networks that the BGP router that it represents would originate in an "actual" network.


## Elements

The BGP-speakers on our network are represented as "nodes" on a directed graph (dig), and the links between them (transport+eBGP-session) are "edges" on the same graph.

## Properties

- "Statefulness" is a boolean value that describes whether or not a node tracks/enforces connection state for bi-directional traffic flows between two nodes.  Put more plainly: "whether the node will refuse to forward traffic if it does not "see" *both* flows in a bidirectional flow-pair between two other nodes.
  - This will be important later, when we start building *paths* through the graph
  - We depict statefulness in the visual graph by depicting the node with a dashed perimeter (non-stateful nodes have a solid perimeter)
- "Security-zone" is a label/tag used to identify nodes which may communicate with each other *without* passing through a "stateful" node.
  - That is to say, that any path between two nodes in different security zones (with different zone-ID values/colors) *must* include at least one stateful node
    *Conversely, there must be a path between nodes in the same security zone that does *not* traverse any stateful nodes
  - We depict the security-zone of a node by coloring the node's perimeter  (each unique color is a distinct security zone)
- "Site" is a property of the links between devices on the network
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in the same site with a label ending in ".0"
    - All edges between nodes in the *same* site will have will have identical labels
  - We will denote edges representing links between nodes in different sites with a label ending in ".*n*" (where *n* is a non-zero integer)

## Graphs of the topology

The figure below is a translation of the figure at the top of this page to a graph, using the conventions described in the preceding section.

[![image](./grphth-11.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-11.svg){:target="_blank"}

The two figures below show the same graph, with the elements' visual orentation shifted, but no changes to the underlying structure of the graph itself.

[![image](./grphth-12.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./pages/1/3(ecmp-symmetric)/grphth-12.svg){:target="_blank"}

The preceding figures illustrate the following observation of our network/graph's structure:
> For every "non-zero" site value "*n*", a stateful site *n* node is connected to a stateless site *0* node, and a stateless site *n* node is connected to a statefu site *0* node.

## Rules of Inference

We use the following rules of inference in building our graph (network topology):

* A node may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * Each node is characterized as either "statefu" (dashed line) or "stateless" (solid line)
  * Each node is characterized with a single security zone (a unique color per security zone on the graph)
* Edges may be instantiated under the following conditions
  * A path that does *not* include a stateful node *must* exist between all stateless nodes with the same security-zone property
  * An edge between two different security zones *must* connect to stateful nodes
    * Unless the node has the a value of "0" for its security-zone property, in which case the node with zone property of "0" may be stateless
* Edges are labeled using the following conventions
  * Connections between edges in the same "site" end in ".0"
  * Connections between edges in different "sites" end in ".*n*" where "*n*" is a non-zero integer.


## Generalization

Let's revisit how "site", "zone", and "statefulness" properties related to each other and see if it can be further generalized:

* Site (a property of edges): 
  * Will influence *preferred* paths through the graph.
    * With no preference for bidrectional symmetry of the path
* Zone and statefulness (properties of nodes)
  * Will influence *permitted paths through the graph
  * With paths traversing "stateful" nodes requiring bidrectional symetry
