## Zones as a Recursive Concept

Applying the concept of recursion to zones follows the same pattern as applying it to recursion, once we get past the initial hurdle of more fully conceptualizing what the "transit zone" *is  (in raltion to the other zones).

## Re-visiting the "network security zone" concept

### Trusted or Un-Trusted: *that* is the question

In the *simplest* conceptual model for network-security zones, there are only two classifications:  "trusted", and "un-trusted", and it is presumed that *you* own/control/operate the "trusted" zone, and some *other* group operates the un-trusted zone.  If two networks with separate owners/operators want to connect, but regard each other as "un-trusted", the most direct solution is the "back-to-back-firewalls" topology.   From *your* perspective, your firewall and everything on *your* side of it are "trusted" and everything on the other side is "untrusted."  From the *other* network's perspective, the situation is reversed.  They regard *their* firewall and everything on *their* side of as "trusted", and everything on the *other* side as "untrusted."

What about the network *between* the two firewalls, though?  *Nobody* in this scenario regards that segment of the network as trusted (hence the "no-man's land" moniker.)  In that scenario, if you (and the other network's owner) wanted to *also* connect to multiple *additional* (separately administered; mutually un-trusted) networks, it would be more efficient for you to all *share* that no-man's-land region for mutual interconnection.  The "transit" zone we've been discussing *is* that multi-party no-man's-land.

The no-man's land framework does raise a new question though:

>Who is responsible for the no-man's-land / "transit zone"?

When I said that *nobody* regarded the no-mans's land as "trusted", I left out the owner/operator *of* the no-man's-land.  *They* might regard it as "trusted", because it is under their control.  They might *also* regard it as "un-trusted" because they can't control what gets into (or out of) it through all those other organizations' firewalls.  (That binary "trusted/untrusted" model doesn't deal well with shades-of-grey.)

### Shades of Gray

Instead of a binary (trusted/un-trusted) though, we might use a *range* of values to denote the *level* of trust we assign to a specific zone, or we might throw "trust" out the window and decide that "risk profile" is a better way of grouping nodes into security zones.

It is *also* worth considering that *we* (as owners/operators of the network) *can* assign some level of trust to the transit-zone.  In the context of the framework we're developing, "we" are in control of *all* of the zones and there is nothing *inherently* untrustworthy/risky about the transit-zone itself.  (It is populated only with what *we* choose to put there, after all.) 

## Hierarchical relationship of transit zone (zone "0") to other zones

In terms of how the network/graph is constructed, it doesn't really *matter* whether we consider a "zone" be defined by a shared level of trust, or a shared risk-profile (or the last character of its MAC-address).  The *functional* distinction we have is:

* Edges may connect *any* two nodes in the *same* zone
* Edges may connect any transit-zone nodes to  stateful-nodes-only in *other* security zones. 

This gives a functional tree, with the transit zone as the root.  Every other zone *must* have an edge that connects to the transit zone.  (This is a hierarchical relationship)

So, how *does* this pattern recurse?   With zone-0 as the root of our zone-tree, our reference topology has three additional zones (all children of zone-0):  zone-0.1, zone-0.2, and zone-0.3.  Applied recursively, each of *those* zones may act as a transit-zone/parent for any sub-zones they contain.  The most significant design-decision here is whether the connection from a parent-zone to the child-zone should to terminate on a stateful node on either end.

> We will use the term "**Zone Depth**" (ZD) to refer to the number of parent-child relationships between a node's zone and the root/top level of the zone-hierarchy.

## Depicting recursive "zone" structures in the graph

The following figure depicts the reference topology, modified to add two single-level-recursed sub-zones to zone 0.1, and two single-level-recursed subzones to zone 0.3.  The latter two each have their own two (2nd-level-recursed) sub-zones.

## Do zone-depth-traversing edges connect nodes that are *stateful* or nodes that are *stateless*?

The initial pattern we are using as the basis for recursion calls for edges between the parent ("0"/"transit") zone its it child-zones ("0.1", "0.2", "0.3") to land on *stateful* nodes in the child-zone, and *stateless* nodes in the parent-zone.  We carry that pattern forward here.

### *Stateful nodes* in the child-zone node of an inter-zone-edge

Our *definition* of a security zone is based on paths in/out of the zone passing through a stateful node in that zone.

#### *Stateless nodes* in the parent-zone.

Relative to the child-zones, the nominal *purpose* of the parent-zone is to provide a path between its child-zones.  The stateful nodes on the "child-zone-side" of each partent/child-zone are "protecting" the nodes within the child-zone, and the nodes within the parent-zone are concurrently protected by those same stateful-edges.  Adding a stateful edge to the parent-zone side would only duplicate the existing controls on the child-side edge.

At this point, it would be entirely reasonable to say: "*well, yes... at the **top** of the zone-hierarchy (the data-plane of the multi-zone firewall in the preamble of this paper), there's an implicit trust that the parent/transit zone is "secure", but why should that presumption carry through to **lower zone-depths**?*

The answer to that is:  I have no idea if it should or shouldn't.  But, if you *don't*, and you decide to have the parent-node of a zone-depth-traversing edge be a stateful node, you'd be better served with two zones at the *same* level of the zone-hierarchy.  The only real benefit *inherent* to a hierarchical zone structure is the the stateful-nodes of the *parent* zone are spared from having to process traffic between the sub-zones.  The following figure illustrates a set of zone-depth-2 zones (0.1.1, 0.1.2) attached to depth-1 zone 0.1's stateful-node.  It also illustrates two zone-depth-2 zones attached to a stateless node in their parent-zone  (on the right side of the graph.)

Observation of the available paths quickly reveals that with the parent-side node of inter-zone-depth edges landing on a stateful node:

* Paths between neighbor child-zones must traverse *three* stateful nodes (rather than two)
* Paths between child-zone and parent zone must traverse *two* stateful nodes (rather than one)

And that with parent-side node of inter-zone edges landing on stateless nodes:

* Paths between neighbor child-zones must traverse *two* stateful nodes (rather than three)
* Paths between child-zone and parent zone must traverse *one* stateful node (rather than two)
