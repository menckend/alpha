summary: "An refined iteration of our 'graph' representation of the reference network"
---

Having further formalized the properties of our nodes and edges, we will now update our undirected graph model of our reference network topology.

## The Node-index property

We start be adding an additional property for nodes in the graph.  The "node-index" property is an integer that must be unique to each node on the graph.  Here, it is a functional stand-in for the autonomous system number (ASN) of a BGP router, as well as all networks that it originates into BGP.

The node index is depicted in the graph in black text, centered in the node.

## The Symmetric Perimeter Zone (SP zone) property

The symmetric perimeter zone property of each node is represented on the graph by the *color* used to depict the node (the shading of the actual circle).  The visual figure of the graph includes a key for mapping each color to an explicit value for the SPZ property of the nodes of that color.

Those values are formatted to reflect the hierarchical nature of the SPN zone structure (as discussed in the previous section), with the addition of an "implicit root" value of 0.  

This implicit root ("0.") does not exist in any "real" sense, but provides namespace headroom for us to contemplate representation of completely disjoint graphs (that is, networks)

## The Site Property

## Edge Labels

The "site" property of edges is also updated with an implicit "root" at the top of the site hierarchy (also "0").  Similarly to the implicit root of the SPZ hierarchy, this presents on the graph only as a prepended value of "0." to the "site" property of each edge, and exists to provide "headroom" for representation of disjoint site hierarchies.

The implicit root of the site hierarchy is a(n implicit) node, connected to an (implicit) edge that is connected to each site node at the root/top of *our* graph's site hierarchy.

Edge labels are constructed as follows:
