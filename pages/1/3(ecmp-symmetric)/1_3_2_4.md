## Sites

We define "site" as a group of nodes on the network are are within the same metropolitan area as each other.  As discussed in the preamble, this is a relatively arbitrary distinction, and one that largely boils down to nodes that are "close enough" that we prefer traffic between nodes stay within that "site."
