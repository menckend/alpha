# Zones as a Recursive Concept

Applying the concept of recursion to zones follows the same pattern as applying it to recursion, once we get past the initial hurdle of more fully conceptualizing what the "transit zone" *is*, relative to the other zones.

##  Hierarchical relationship of zone "0" to other zones

In the *simplest* conceptual model for network-security zones, there are only two classifications:  "trusted", and "un-trusted", and it is presumed that *you* own/control/operate the "trusted" zone, and some *other* group operates the un-trusted zone.  If two networks with separate owners/operators want to connect, but regard each other as "un-trusted", you get the timeless  "back-to-back-firewalls" topology.   From *your* perspective, your firewall and everything on *your* side of it are "trusted" and everything on the other side is "untrusted."  From the *other* network's perspective, the situation is reversed.  They regard *their* firewall and everything on *their* side of as "trusted", and everything on the *other* side as "untrusted."

But.. what about the portion of the network *between* the two firewalls?  *Nobody* in this scenario regards that segment as trusted, hence the "no-man's land" moniker.  In that scenario, if you (and the other network's owner) wanted to *also* connect to multiple *additional* (separately administered; mutually un-trusted) networks, it would be more efficient for you to all *share* that no-man's-land region for mutual interconnection.  That raises vexing questions about who would be responsible for operating the no-man's land.  We'll get to them next...

The "transit" zone we've been discussing *is* the multi-party no-man's-land described above.  Earlier, when I said that *nobody* regarded the no-mans's land as "trusted", I left out the owner/operator *of* the no-man's-land.  *They* would regard it as "trusted".

### Better Illustrating the Recursion

The following figure presents an alternate arrangement of the same graph, which more intuitively illustrates the recursive nature of its structure.

Security zones might also be nested nested using a similar mechanism, although in this case the distinction between child/parent object has a deeper policy significance in the real-world networks that we are modelling.  If we entertain the concept of recursively structured network security zones, it becomes quickly apparent that there is a parent-child relationship between "transit zone" and "workload-hosting zone", and that the a workload-hosting-zone with "child" sub-zones *is* the transit-zone for it child/sub-zones.  As illustrated in the following figures:
