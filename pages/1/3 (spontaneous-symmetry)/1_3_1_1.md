title: "Initial Design Iteration"
permalink: 1_3_1_1.html
summary: "Inter-site connectivity is limited to a single security-zone, which becomes a de-facto transit-zone."
---

## Design elements

The initial design iteration included the following elements:
  - Two workload-hosting sites (sites 1/2)
  - Three VRFs for workload-hosting subnets (network secuirty zones A/B/C)
  - All zones are present at each site
  - A single HA FW pair is present in each DC, with a "leg" in each security zone
  - Inter-data-center connectivity is provisioned for zone "A" only
  - eBGP sessions are established between the firewall and each of the three workload VRFs at each site

## Graphical Depiction
This design is depicted in the following diagram

## Gaps / Limitations

This design iteration was sub-optimal in the following regards:
- Inter-site/intra-zone traffic for zones 2 and 3
  - Traversed firewalls at site 1 and at site 2
    - Desired behavior is to traverse *no* firewalls
  - Had a transport path that included zone 1
    - Desired behavior was for traffic to only be present in workload-hosting security zones if the traffic's source or destination was present in that zone


These gaps are illustrated in the following figure, illustrating the path taken for traffic from hosts in Site-1/Zone-3 to Site-2/Zone-3.

## Retrospection

Hosts in every security-zone at every site *were* able to communicate, but the double-inspection of inter-site/intra-zone traffic for zones 2 and 3 was an immediate priority for remediation.
