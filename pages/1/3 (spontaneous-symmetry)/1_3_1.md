### Exposition

An enterprise has its IT workload hosted at multiple locations.  It segregates its networks into multiple network-security zones and requires that any traffic moving between zones traverse network firewalls.

The enterprise establishes the following design objectives
  - Traffic between endpoints in the same zone should not traverse *an*y network firewalls
  - Traffic between endpoints in separate security zones should traverse *only one* firewall at the edge of each (src/dst) security zone
  - Traffic between endpoints in the same site should not exit the site as part of the transit path

The enterprise works through multiple design iterations, getting incrementally closer to optimal pathing.  However, the fundamental problem remains:
  - Existing mechanisms for path selection across ECMP links result in inconsistent forward/reverse path selections.

The subsequent pages in this section illustrate and explicate various design iterations the led to the novel framework presented in the following section.
