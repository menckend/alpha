Enterprises with multiple network security zones spread across multiple locations and gated by stateful inspection services face several challenges related to optimization.

The desired/optimal behavior is:
  - Traffic will *not* traverse any firewalls if the source and destination are in the same security zone
  - Traffic *will* traverse firewalls if the source and destination are in separate security zones
  - Traffic won't traverse *multiple* firewalls on the same security-zone's perimeter
  - Traffic with source and destination at the same site will not take a hairpin/trombone path through a separate site

Historically, "sacrifices were made", with regards to achieving some of these objectives at the expense of others.

This is no longer necessary.
