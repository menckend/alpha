title: "Second Design Iteration"
permalink: 1_3_1_2.html
summary: "Inter-site connectivity is added for the additional security zones.  Routing must be explicitly manipulated to maintain the de-facto transit-zone for all any inter-site+inter-zone traffic. "

## Design elements

The second design iteration modified the initial design iteration with the following additions
  - Firewall instances are conceptualized as per-zone entities with a firewall-cluster-local transit path between zones
    - This reflects the internal architecture of the firewall platform in use
    - It is also critical to subsequent design iterations
  - Inter-data-center connectivity is provisioned for zones 2 and 3 (supplementing the existing IDC for zone 1)
    - This enables desired behavior for all intra-zone/inter-site flows
      - Which no longer traverse *any* firewalls (compared to the two firewalls in the initial design iteration)
    - This also *breaks* that same behavior, as well as previously working behavior
      - There are now multiple equal-cost paths for all inter-site/inter-zone traffic, each of which traverses a different combination of firewall instances.
      - BGP local-prefence is manipulated through route-maps acting on site-level and zone-level ip prefix-list primitives
        - Forcing all inter-site/intra-zone traffic to prefer same-zone WAN/DCI path
        - Forcing all inter-site/inter-zone traffic to prefer the path through the zone-1 FWs and zone-1 WAN
          - Leaving intact the previous gap of security-zone "1" functioning as a de-facto "transit zone" for all inter-site/inter-zone traffic


## Graphical Depiction
This design is depicted in the following diagram

## Gaps / Limitations

This design iteration was sub-optimal in the following regards:

  - Security-zone "1" still functions as a de-facto "transit zone" for all inter-site/inter-zone traffic
    - We don't want traffic between zones 2 and 3 routed across zone 1.
    - We don't want zone 1's firewall rule configuration to include traffic that is not to or from zone 1
  - Route-policy configuration overhead increases quickly as the number of sites and zones is increased
    - Route-map configuration is inconsistent across zones
    - Multiple IP prefix-lists must be duplicated across multiple routers
