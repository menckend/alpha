# Recapping
We'll use our last depiction of the graph (pictured below) from the previous section as a starting point.

If we want symmetrical paths (or at least, "symmetrical enough" that they hit the same stateful nodes) we need a criteria for path selection that chooses the same edges regardless of which of the two nodes is executing the decision.

As discussed in the preamble, the reason that existing forwarding selection mechanisms (BGP ECMP in this case) don't provide that symmetry is that their algorithms operate on hashes of characteristics of the source and destiation of the traffic, and those values are inverted for the two flows.

#  The problem, again.

The "problem" is that we want to enforce (pseudo-)symmetric routing in our network, while maintaining resiliency and load-sharing across multiple links and state-enforcing hops.  To guarantee that the same path is selected in "both directions", the path-selection mechanism *has* to act on information about both the destination *and* the source.  That's because the source and destination are *inverted* in the bi-directional flows between two endpoints.  The proverbial kick in the head is that IP routing makes forwarding decisions based on *destination* addresses only (unless we utilize policy routing.)  Generally speaking, we don't *want* to use policy routing if we don't *need* to, because it requires *per-packet* inspection of whatever fields we're basing our policy on.  Even if per-flow (rather than per-packet) classification is still possible, that classification requires inspecting the IP *source*-headers, which requires (or has required, historically) execution on sparse/costly generic CPU resources (rather than the preferred switching ASICs.)

# The solution (in theory)

What we "care" about is that both members of a bi-directional flow-pair between two nodes, traverse the same state-enforcing nodes.  One thing that *does* differentiate our  equi-distant paths is the PAG values (which 'locations') the SPN nodes are in.  Our architecture dictates that all inter-PAG/inter-SPZ flows will traverse *two* SPN nodes (one each with the same SPZ vlaue as an endpoint).   One of the three potential equi-distant paths has both SPN nodes in the same *PAG* as node-A, one has two SPN nodes in the same PAG as node-B, and one has an SPN node with each endpoint's PAG value.

## Bidirectional consistency in path ***identification***

We can describe the three potential equidistant paths as:
 - The one with more SPN nodes that share node-A's PAG value
 - The one with more SPN nodes that share node-B's PAG value
 - The one with an equal number of SPN nodes that share node-A and node-B's PAG value

That description *is* bi-directionally consistent, but requires that each forwarding/transport node know (and agree on) node-A's PAG value and node-B's PAG value, as well as the number of SPN nodes in each path (and the PAG value of each one).

The first problem is agreeing on what "node-A" and "node-B" are.  In one flow, node-A is the *source*, in the other flow, it's the *destination*.  Instead of describing the paths in terms of *node-A* and *node-B*'s PAG value, we could instead describe them in terms of "the *higher* or *lower* of node A/B's PAG values.  If node-A has a PAg value of "10" and node-B has a PAG value of "20", we would end up evaluating "the higher of *10 and 20*" in one direction, and "the higher of *20 and 10*" in the other direction.  (In both cases, it resolves to "20.")  That brings us to:
> We'll describe/differentiate our paths as:
> - The one with more SPN nodes sharing the PAG value of the 'higher' of the two endpoints' PAG values
> - The one with more SPN nodes sharing the PAG value of the 'lower' of the two endpoints' PAG values
> - The one with an equal number of SPN nodes sharing the PAG value of each endpoint

We could also base our evaluation on a comparison of node A/B's symmetric-perimeter zone (SPZ) values, instead of *path-affinity-group*-values.

## Bidirectional consistency in path ***selection***

Now that we can *identify* each of the potential equal-cost paths in a bidirectionally-consistent manner, we need to figure out how to decide *which* of those paths we want to use for any given bidirectional flow-pair.  We want this decision process to:
- Be bi-directionally consistent
- Load-share (at the endpoint-pair level) across all of the equal-cost paths
- Provide resiliency in the event of failure on any of the three paths

To do this, we need an evaluation function that provides the same results when its two input parameters are reversed and provides a (near) uniform distribution across three output values.  

Although it's tempting, we can't just XOR the IP-addresses (or PAG, or SPZ values) of the endpoints and perform a modulo-3 division on the result.  That *would* work well for consistency and load-sharing, but would *not* work well for resiliency (we'd need to change our modulo arithmetic every time one of the equal-cost paths showed up).  Also, it would require policy-based routing, which we very-much want to avoid.

To avoid policy-based routing, we will try to use a model that *achieves the desired results exlusively by modifying which routes are preferred by BGP* (and eschewing source headers in forwarding decisions.)

We use our observations about the distribution of PAG, SPZ, and SPN nodes values across the graph in our prescribed topology to safely let every forwarding/transport node use it's *own* PAG value as a *proxy* for the source-node's PAG value.  This is a viable approach *only* so long as the individual forwarding/transport nodes *that have to select from among the equal-cost paths* have *the same* PAG as the source/transmitting node of the packet that they are forwarding.  The path selection logic that *almost* solves our problem if we apply it on a per-node basis is as follows:

> - Unless the destination has a different PAG *and* SPZ value from the current node *and* there are multiple shortest paths  
> -     Use the path(s) from the current node to the destination node that has the fewest number of edges (select all paths if there are multiple paths with the same/fewest number of edges)
> - If there *are* multiple shortest paths to the destination *and* the destination has a different PAG value *and* different SPZ value from the current node
>   - Select a *single* path, using the following preferences
>       - Do not select a path in which the next node has a different PAG 'depth' than the current node un-preferred.
>       - Among the shortest paths in which the next node has the same PAG depth as the current node:
>           - If the SPZ value of the destination node is *higher* than the SPZ value of the current node, prefer the path with the *most* SPN nodes whose PAG value matches the PAG value of the *current* node
>           - If the SPZ value of the destination node is *lower* than the SPZ value of the current node, prefer the path with the *most* SPN nodes whose PAG value matches the PAG value of the *destination* node
>       - Make any path in which the next node has the same PAG 'depth' ase the current node "more" preferred.


## Why does this work?

As mentioned above, this scheme works as long as the nodes with multiple equal-cost paths have the same PAG and SPZ values as the source-node in the flow. In the previously discussed sample-case of the flow-pairs between nodes "14" and "22" in our steady-state topology, that is *almost* the case:

[![image](./grphth-23-steady-state.svg){:class="img-fluid"}](./grphth-23-steady-state.svg){:target="_blank"}

As illustrated above, our logic (when evaluated on the path as a whole -- against the *actual* endpoints' PAG and SPZ values), selects path "A".  Node 14 (one endpoint) has a PAG value of 0.1.1 and SPZ value of 0.0.1, while node 22 (the other endpoint) has PAG 0.1.3 and SPZ 0.0.3.  As such, we want to select the path with the most SPN nodes in PAG 0.1.3.  (That's path "a", in the above figure)

But, when we use each individual node's SPZ and PAG values as proxy for the source-node's SPZ/PAG values, we run into a potential problem.  What happens on node "4" in the flow from node 22 to node 14 using path "a"?  It is in a *different* SPZ than the originating node, so it has a *different* basis of comparison when comparing it's SPZ to that of the destination node than the originating node did.  Node 4 has an SPZ value of 0.0 (wherease the origin, node 22, has an SPZ value of 0.0.3.  Finding the greater of "0.0 and 0.0.1" gives us a diferrent answer than finding the greater of "0.0.3 and 0.0.1"!

*That* is why we included the provision to *not* select a path in which the next-node has a different PAG depth than the current node (when multiple equal-length paths are available.)
