### The Large Community Attribute

[RFC 8092](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8092) defines the BGP large community attribute.  It states that:

> This attribute provides a mechanism to signal opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing management.  The attribute is suitable for use with all Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) including four-octet ASNs.

The same RFC specifies the structure of the large-community attribute:

> Each BGP Large Community value is encoded as a 12-octet quantity, as follows:
> - Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.
> - Local Data Part 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.
> - Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet operator-defined value.
>
> The canonical representation of BGP Large Communities is three separate unsigned integers in decimal notation in the following order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers MUST NOT contain leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented with a single zero.  Each number is separated from the next by a single colon.  For example: 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0


BGP large-communities are a handy mechanism for adding an extra signaling layer to BGP route updates. We can define arbitrary key/value pairs to signal multiple
properties of interest. Those key value pairs are encoded as multiple values within the BGP "large-community" attribute on a BGP route advertisement. We have to
encode them as purely numerical values but an offline code-book can imbue them with whatever "meaning" we want. A BGP large-community value is canonically
written as three unsigned integers, each separated by a colon
