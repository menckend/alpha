### The Large Community Attribute

[RFC 8092](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8092) defines the BGP large community attribute.  It states that:


<a href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8092">
> This attribute provides a mechanism to signal opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing management.  The attribute is suitable for use with all Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) including four-octet ASNs. 
</a>



BGP large-communities are a handy mechanism for adding an extra signaling layer to BGP route updates. We can define arbitrary key/value pairs to signal multiple
properties of interest. Those key value pairs are encoded as multiple values within the BGP "large-community" attribute on a BGP route advertisement. We have to
encode them as purely numerical values but an offline code-book can imbue them with whatever "meaning" we want. A BGP large-community value is canonically
written as three unsigned integers, each separated by a colon
