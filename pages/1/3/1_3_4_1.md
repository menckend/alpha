### Meet The Large Community Attribute

[RFC 8092](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc8092) defines the BGP large community attribute.  It states that:

> This attribute provides a mechanism to signal opaque information within separate namespaces to aid in routing management.  The attribute is suitable for use with all Autonomous System Numbers (ASNs) including four-octet ASNs.

The same RFC specifies the structure of the large-community attribute:

> Each BGP Large Community value is encoded as a 12-octet quantity, as follows:
> - Global Administrator:  A four-octet namespace identifier.
> - Local Data Part 1:  A four-octet operator-defined value.
> - Local Data Part 2:  A four-octet operator-defined value.

Representation of the large community attribute is also defined in the same RFC:

> The canonical representation of BGP Large Communities is three separate unsigned integers in decimal notation in the following order: Global Administrator, Local Data 1, Local Data 2.  Numbers MUST NOT contain leading zeros; a zero value MUST be represented with a single zero.  Each number is separated from the next by a single colon.  For example: 64496:4294967295:2, 64496:0:0

RFC 8195 provides guidance for the use of this attribute that can be summarized as:

> - The first value, the Global Administrator field, should be an AS number.
> - Interpreetation of the values of the two remaining fields ("Local Data Part 1" and "Local Data Part 2") in the large community attribute are to be interpreted as defined by the owner of the AS number in the Global Administrator field.


### Applying the Large Community Attribute Within This Framework

The following BGP large community type/value pairs are proposed here to tag BGP route updates with data relevant to the routing policy framework presented in the previous section of this paper:

> {:class="table table-bordered"}
> | Local Data 1 Value | Local Data 1 Meaning | Local Data 2 Value | Local Data 2 Meaning |
> |---|---|---|---|
> | 122881 | Key/type is the SPZ in which the route was originated | 1-100 | Discrete values for 100 SPZs |

> | 122885 | Key/type is the SPZ of the router propagating the route | 1-100 |  |
> | 122886 | Key/type is the SPN property of the router propagating the route | 1-100 |  |
