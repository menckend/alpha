This section demonstrates how the symmetric-perimeter zone (SPZ) and path-affinity group (PAG) of the node/router which originates a prefix may be encoded in the BGP update messages in which the prefix is originated.  It then demonstrates how the path selection algorithm can be implemented using a uniform route-map configuration which acts on that information as a tie-breaker when equal-cost paths are present.
