title: "Embedding SPZ, PAG, and SPN values in device configuration"
permalink: 1_3_4_2.html
summary: "Nodes participating in the BGP reference implementation of this framework must be statically configured in a manner that encodes the SPZ, PAG, and SPN values of the node in a manner that is accessible to the node's BGP policy logic."
---

### What Values are Statically Configured?

Each node/router/BGP-speaker in this reference implementation will have administratively defined values for each of the following:

> **OSPZ**: The value (an integer between 0 and 100) of the Symmetric Perimeter Zone (SPZ) of which the node/router/BGP-speaker is a member

> **OPAG**:  The value (an integer between 0 and 100) of the Path Affinity Group (PAG) of which the node/router/BGP-speaker is a member

> **SPN**: The value (a boolean type, expressed as 0 or 1) of the node/router's Symmetric Perimeter Node (SPN) property.  "0" if the node is *not* an SPN, and "1" if the node "is" an SPN.

### How are the values encoded?

We will be using the BGP large community attribute to signal SPZ, PAG, and SPN information in BGP route updates, but every node/router in the network must be explicitly configured with the administratively assigned values of its own SPZ, PAG, and SPN properties.  Those values must also be accessible to the logic in the BGP policy configuration of the routers.  We will use a cobination of route-map configuration and large-community-list configuration to encode each device's values.

n this reference implemenation, we will use autonomous system number 64496 for the Global Administrator Field in the BGP Large Community Attributes.

#### Symmetric Perimeter Zone (SPZ)

As previously described, each node/router will have an administratively assigned SPZ value.  We will record that value within the node/router's configuration using the "large-community-list" feature, so as expose the value to the router's BGP policy configuration mechanism.  We use large-communities with Local Data Part 1 values of 122881 and 122885 (as per the schema presented in the previous section) and Local Data Part 2 values selected during the design of the network.

There are two distinct IP prefix lists ("...**O**SPZ...", "...**P**SPZ...") defined, both evaluating against the same SPZ value.  This is because we will need to differentiate BGP policy behavior later based on whether the router is *originating* or *propagating* a route. This is demonstrated in the following configuration template/snippet.

``` 
ip large-community-list OSPZ permit 64496:12288**1**:[$mySPZ]
ip large-community-list PSPZ permit 64496:12288**5**:[$mySPZ]
``` 

For a router "in" SPZ "8", that rendered configuration would be:

> ip large-community-list OSPZ permit 64496:122881:8
> ip large-community-list PSPZ permit 64496:122885:8

#### Path Affinity Group (PAG)

A router's PAG property is configured using the same mechanism as the SPZ value, but with large-communities using LD Part 1 values of "2" and "4" (instead of "1" and "5"; as per the schema presented in the previous section):

``` 
ip large-community-list OPAG permit 64496:12288**2**:[$my-SPZid]
ip large-community-list PPAG permit 64496:12288**4**:[$my-SPZid]
```


#### Symmetric Perimeter Node (SPN)

As previously described, some nodes on the network will execute services that cause traffic to be discarded if only *one* of a set of source/destination-inverted flow-pairs between two endpoints traverses the node  (as with network firewalls.)  Nodes that do execute such services are assigned an SPN value of "1" (true), while nodes that do not execute such services are assigned an SPN value of "0" (false).  The routing policy framework that we are implementing here executes different logic based on whether the router propagating the route is an SPN or is not an SPN, so we will need to encode that in a manner accessible to the routing-policy engine.

```
ip large-community-list am-I-SPN permit 64496:12288**6**:[$mySPN]
```

### What Operations Are Performed on These Values?

The path selection algorithm that we are implementing requires the following operations/evaluations:

- Is the $OPAG value of a learned BGP route the same as the learning router's PAG value?
  - Trivial to implement with route-map logic
- Is the $OSPZ value of a learned BGP route the same as the learning router's SPZ value?
  - Trivial to implement with route-map logic
- Is the router's SPN value true or false?
  - Trivial to implement with route-map logic
- Numerical comparison of router's SPZ value to route-advertisement's $OSPZ
  - Klunky, but feasible, to implement with route-map logic

#### How Are These Operations Are Performed?
