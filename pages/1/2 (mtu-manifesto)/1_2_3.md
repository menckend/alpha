### Vertical Interface Design in Message-Oriented Protocols

> - Does not  _expose_  the interface’s MPU to upstack\-adjacent interfaces
>
> - Does not  _consume_  the downstack\-adjacent interface’s MPU to infer its own MTU
>
> This breaks the  _value_  of layered architectures\, forcing us to go  _outside the stack_  to get L\( _n\-1_ \) information in order to configure L\( _n_ \)


### IP overlays / “In-network-tunneling” Break PMTUD for the Overlay

> It’s literally  _not_  possible for an IP\-tunneling interface to infer enough from an underlay PTB message to translate it into the overlay network

### Common Design Practices Exacerbate MTU Issues

> Stacked overlays

> Encapsulating protocols with variable header lengths

> Heterogenous L( _n_) MTUs in the same L( _n_) broadcast domain
