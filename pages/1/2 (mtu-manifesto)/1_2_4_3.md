# Encapsulation Ad Absurdum

It’s not uncommon to see  _three _ or more recursive overlay encapsulations

E\.g\. K8s VXLAN overlay on a hypervisor\-networking GENEVE overlay on a data\-center VXLAN overlay

That’s triple the risk of getting your math wonky while calculating what the nominal IP interface MTU should be\.


## Illustrated

\{IP header\} \{Payload\}

\{Eth headers\} \{Payload\} \{CRC\}

\{Eth\} \{IP\} \{UDP\} \{VXLAN\} \{Payload\} \{CRC\}

\{Eth\} \{IP\} \{UDP\} \{GENEVE\} \{     Payload     \} \{CRC\}

\{Eth\}  \{IP\} \{UDP\} \{VXLAN\} \{         Payload         \} \{CRC\}


# Failure to Implement PLPMTUD

* PLPMTUD solves  _all_  of the problems we’ve discussed
  * But\, only at the packetization\-layer\, not at the IP Layer\.
* It has been part of the TCP implementation in Linux and Windows for  _years_ \, but it is not enabled by default\.
* If your device has a TCP implementation and it’s  _not_  doing PLPMTUD?
  * Shame\!  Shame; shame; shame\.


# Jumbo Gumbo

* It’s a \(not  _un\-_ \)reasonable practice to set the  _gateway’s_  IP MTU to 9000 when enabling jumbo frames on an Ethernet broadcast domain\.
* It’s a  \(not  _un\-_ \)common practice to do this  _without requiring_  every host on the same subnet to:
  * Have an L2 MRU of 9022\(\-ish\) bytes
  * Have an L3 MRU of 9000 bytes
* This creates a PMTUD blackhole if any of those hosts  _don’t_  happen to have L2/L3 MRUs at least that high
