summary: "Is this even feasible?  I hope so, but you knew things were going to get weird when you started reading something with the word 'manifesto' in the title."

If you create/maintain network protocol interface software, please start thinking about the following changes in strategy:

- Start _exposing_ M_P_U in the _up_-stack direction
- Start _consuming_ M_P_U from the _down_-stack direction as a basis for interface MTU inference
  - `If:L(_n-1_)`:M_P_U = `If:L(_n_)`:M_T_U
- Start _exposing_ MTU, MRU, and MPU via the management plane
