summary: "Assumptions aren't meant to be proven, but they DO need to be stated."

These asumptions frame the rest of this article:

- _Many_  applications recover gracefully from path MTU discovery \(PMTUD\) blackholes
  - A  _non\-trivial_  portion of applications _donâ€™t_  
- MTU dysfunction  _abounds_  in modern networks
- There  _are_   _valid_  use\-cases for jumbo Ethernet
- PMTUD is  _preferable_  to manually decreasing interface MTU
- Maximizing operational stability and efficiency in delivery of IT sericees is desirable.
- The cure should never be worse than the disease
- Packet loss on IP networks leads to application performance problems, which adversely impacts operational stability
  - MTU mismatches are an easily remediated cause of undetected packet loss
- Path MTU Discovery (PMTU) provides a mechanism for two hosts on separate subnetes/broadcast domains with an MTU mismatch between them to compensate and avoid adverse impact
  - But PMTUD "in real life" is a fragile framework
- Ethernet and IP networks represents the overwhelming majority of enterprise networks
- Commonly adopted networks design practices result in widespread MTU mismatch
- Modern public/private cloud hosting architectures often involve multiple layers of nested encapsulation as part of recursive underlay/overlay services
- Remediating MTU mismatch introduces its own risks to operational stability
- Most devices on enterprise networks have explicitly configured network interface MTU values
- Most devices on enterprise networks consume DHCP services for IP address assignment
