title: "Glossary of Terms and Neologisms"

summary: "Since the industry at large uses often ambivalent if not outright contradictory definitions for various terms, it's helpful for level-set exactly what we mean when discussing MTU, MRU, packet size, and frame size."

This article uses the following definitions:

- Layer-3 MTU
  - The maximum size (Layer-3) datagram that can be transmitted through the "next" network.
  - Unless otherwise specified, this would typically be the maximum Layer-2 frame size of the "next"(connected) network minus bytes required for the Layer-2 protocol's encapsulating headers
- Layer-3 MRU
  - The maximum size (Layer-3) datagram that can be received from the "next" network.
  - Unless otherwise specified, this would typically be the maximum Layer-2 frame size of the "next"(connected) network minus bytes required for the Layer-2 protocol's encapsulating headers
- Layer-2 MTU
  - The maximum size (Layer-2) frame that can be transmitted on the physical medium
  - This is typically a the maximum frame-size supported by the network interface card
- Layer-2 MRU
  - The maximum size (Layer-2) frame that can be received from the physical medium
  - This is typically the maximum frame-size supported by the network interface card
- Transit network
  - A network to which no workload is attached (only devices that forward traffic across the network)
- Hosting network
  - A network to which workload (devices that create traffic that they send to the network) is attached.
