title: "IP Overlays"
permalink: 1_2_4_2.html
summary: "In-network tunneling (IP overlay) is rotten to the core (as far as PMTUD goes)."
---

#### TL/DR

* In\-network tunneling turns the entire underlay into a PMTUD\-blackhole for the overlay
* The lack of a clear solution probably has a lot to do with ambiguity as to the role\* of tunnel interfaces
* Existing workarounds boil down to either
  * “Throw bigger MTU at the underlay”\, or
  * “Claw back MTU from the overlay”


#### Verbose

###### In-network tunneling / IP-overlay Breaks PMTUD

- There’s  _not_  a working mechanism for underlay PMTU information to make it into the overlay
- The  _entire underlay_  becomes a PMTUD blackhole for the overlay

> How Can This Be?
> 
> - _Hosts_  and  _routers_  have different PMTUD obligations
> - _Routers_  only have to  _generate_  PTB messages
>   - Not  _implement_  path MTU
> - _Hosts_  have to  _implement/maintain_  path MTU state
> - Devices doing IP\-overlay encapsulation are forwarding datagrams \(like a router\)  _and_  generating datagrams \(like a host\)
>   - And \(usually\) fulfilling the PMTUD obligations of  _neither_  role

##### Overlay/Underlay/Tunnel Interfaces

* What happens when Eth\-b receives a PTB to Tu\-a?
  * Does it send the PTB to Tu\-a?
  * Does Tu\-a xlate the PTB into the overlay?
  * Does Tu\-a implement path MTU?
* Status quo\, basically nothing
  * Tu\-a isn’t maintaining its own path\-MTU state
  * Tu\-a isn’t translating the PTB into the overlay

> Why nothing?
>
> - _If_  Tu\-a  _receives_  a PTB from the underlay
> - The PTB itself doesn’t contain enough information to successfully translate it into the overlay
> - Tu\-a typically doesn’t implement path\-MTU because \(?\)…
>   - Everybody wants to buy “wire\-speed” overlay capabilities
>     - And that’s  _not feasible\(?\)_  to implement in\-ASIC?

##### Current Workarounds

- Overlay providers can declare much  _smaller_  MTUs on the overlay network services than on the underlay services and avoid the problem altogether

- Overlay consumers can just decrease their interface MTUs for the same result
