# Path MTU Discovery

(The normative definition)


* Path MTU discovery \(PMTUD\)
  * Uses ICMP\, relies on transit hops to participate
  * Affects  _all_  IP traffic from host A to host B
* Packetization Layer PMTUD \(PLPMTUD\)
  * Uses packetization layer \(TCP\) to  _infer_  path MTU\, only requires endpoints to participate
  * Only affects the specific packetization\-layer socket
* Datagram PLPMTUD \(DPLPMTUD\)
  * PLPMTUD\, but for datagram protocols
  * Has to be implemented at the  _application_  layer

# Stack Adjacency

(A term of art I invented for this analysis.)

The relationship between two interfaces directly above/below each other in the network stack

“Layer  _N_ ” interface notated as: “If:L\( _n_ \)”

Interface immediately  _above_  “If:L\(n\)” in the stack notated as: “If:L\( _n\+1_ \)”

If:L\( _n_ \) is “ _downstack\-adjacent_ ” to If:L\( _n\+1_ \)

If:L\( _n\+1_ \) is “ _upstack\-adjacent_ ” to If:L\( _n_ \)

# Overlay/Underlay Tunnel Endpoints


A Tunnel Endpoint \(TEP\) encapsulates packets from the overlay network into packets on the underlay network for transport\.  \(And vice\-versa\.\)

TEP interfaces are logically “between” overlay and underlay interfaces.  Whether that neighboring relationship is  _vertical_  or  _horizontal _ is… hard to pin down\.

# MTU, Generalized

(I'm taking the liberty of adding some different variations of what we might mean by MTU.)

_Interface_  _ MTU_ : The largest message that a message\-oriented protocol interface will attempt to transmit to its downstack\-adjacent interface.  (This is what we're usually talking about when we describe a network device's "MTU".)

_Effective_  _ MTU_ : The largest message that can be successfully transmitted between two endpoints.  (This is described in RFC 1191.)

_Path_  _ MTU_ : The largest message that an interface  _will attempt_  to send to a specific destination.  (This is described in RFC 1191.)

_Protocol_  _ MTU:_  The largest message permitted by the semantics of the interface’s native protocol.  (This is a term of art that I made up here.)

# Maximum Payload Unit (MPU)

(This is a Menckenism.)

The maximum size  _payload_  that a message\-oriented protocol interface can transmit in a single message

Cannot be greater than interface\-MTU minus protocol encapsulation overhead


---


# Maximum Receive Unit (MRU)

(This is not a Menckenism, per-se.  MRU is formally defined in the context of point-to-point-tunneling-protocol (RFC 2637).  But, I am decontextualizing it for use in this discussion.)

The maximum size message that a message\-oriented protocol interface will  _accept_  from its downstack\-adjacent interfaces

Should not be higher than the protocol\-MTU

_Not_  a  _prescriptive_  element of IP or Ethernet protocol standards \(but maybe it should be?\)

A  _descriptive_  property of any message\-oriented protocol interface
