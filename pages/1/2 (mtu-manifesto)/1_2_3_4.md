title: "Overlay/Underlay MTU mismatches"

If an underlay network uses an IP MTU that is sufficiently larger than the MTUs of the overlay networks it is servicing (larger enough to account for the additional overhead of the encapsulating/tunneling protocols), the nodes on the overlay network will be able to send/receive packets up to the size of their configured MTU.

For instance, containers on a Kubernetes cluster network (an overlay network) with an MTU of 1450 bytes, would be able to send 1450-byte packets to each other (between different nodes on the cluster), because the Ethernet switches the nodes are connected to have a 1500-byte MTU, and the VXLAN encapsulation that is used to transport the overlay network's traffic across the underlay network is approximately 50 bytes.

In contrast, if both networks in the above situation had configured MTUs of 1500, individual containers on the Kubernetes cluster network would observe the following behavior:

- When sending 1500 byte packets to a container on the same node, the packets are delivered.
- When sending up to 1450 byte packets to a container on another node, the packets are delivered.
- When sending packets >1450 bytes to a container on another node, the packets are NOT delivered
  - Hopefully, the Kubernetes worker node hosting the sending container will send a ICMP "PTB" ("packet too big", ICMP Type 3 / Code 4) message to the sending container

However, if the overlay/underlay gateway does not generate and deliver the "fragmentation needed and DF-bit set" messages to the sender, there will be a PMTUD blackhole, and IP connectivity between hosts on the overlay network will be unreliable.
