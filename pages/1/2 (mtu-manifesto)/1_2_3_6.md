summary: "VMWare NSX-T does not allow you to configure per-segment MTUs for virtual-router interfaces on NSX-backed segments."
---
VMWare NSX-T (recently re-branded as "VMWare NSX" as of the 4.x release train) is VMWare's software-defined networking (SDN) product.  If virtual-routing is used for networks attached to an enterprise's VM workload, there are distinct issues.

Specifically, functional limitations within the NSX platform create a scenario in which a single MTU value must be configured for all virtual-router interfaces south of the underlay/overlay gateway's "underlay-facing" network.  As a result, unless you configure *all* of your VM workload with an MTU identical to that of the NSXT-T routers' global MTU value, you will have same-subnet MTU mismatches, and likely PMTUD blackholes even *within* your NSX-T domain.

The following diagram illustrates the layer-3 logical topology of the colo-DC hosting environment with NSX-T virtual-routing enabled:
