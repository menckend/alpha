summary: "What are the best practices for network design around MTU?"
---
These are the key MTU-related design decisions for enterprise networks:

- Should we adopt a uniform-MTU per subnet design principal?
  - It might be operationally unpleasant to maintain separate subnets for each unique MTU-value if you allow a *lot* of different subnets
- What degree of diversity in MTU values should we accept in our networks?
  - The more diversity, the more operational overhead for network deliveyr teams
- Should we accommodate jumbo frames?
- Which iterations of path MTU discovery should be implemented for network-attached workload?
