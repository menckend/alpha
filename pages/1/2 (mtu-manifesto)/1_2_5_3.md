#### Manage Segment MTU!

- Authoritatively  _declare_  an IP MTU for  _every_  subnet that you operate
- Do not permit hosts to exceed the declared MTU in their interface MTU configuration
- Only permit hosts to configure interface MTU that is  _lower_  than the subnet’s declared MTU:
  - _If_ they can successfully demonstrate that their IP M_R_U remains  at least as large as the subnet’s declared MPU
  - Very _begrudgingly_
- Include MTU option whenever DHCP is used

#### Overlay Precautions

* Always prefer the _minimum_ required number of stacked overlays
* Don’t deploy an overlay if you don’t have authoritative knowledge of the underlay’s MTU
* When declaring the IP MTU for an overlay subnet, use a value less-than or equal to:
  * Underlay-MTU _minus_ the overlay's encapsulation overhead

#### Enable PLPMTUD

* Enable PLMTUD in the TCP implementation of any hosts in your networks that support it.
  * This solves PMTUD blackholes for TCP traffic; why are we not doing this already?

#### Bi-modal MTU

* Prefer operational models that implement a bi-modal approach to MTU.
  * 1500-byte MTU for the vast majority of IP-on-Ethernet subnets
  * A “large-MTU” (“of best fit”) for  _your_  organization for everything using jumbo-frames and large IP packets

#### BGP Policy

* Consider tagging routes when they are introduced to BGP, coding for segment MTU
* And applying BGP policy to  _prefer_  paths that maximize higher end-to-end-MTU.
  * This is, admittedly, much simpler if you have a bi-modal MTU approach in your organization
