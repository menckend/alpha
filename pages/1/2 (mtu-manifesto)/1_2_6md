#### “MTU propagation over EVPN Overlays”

Use of ICMP multi-part extension to capture enough of the overlay-packet headers in PTBs so that tunnel interfaces can successfully translate underlay PTB into overlay PTBs

This seems  _very_  promising to me

_Does_  put additional compute burden on TEPs, but seems relatively manageable

##### Purely Speculative Paths to MTU(topia?)


##### IP/ICMP PMTUD w/ inference?


* PMTUD works for  _all_  IP traffic.
  * Implemented at  _IP/ICMP_  layer
* PLPMTUD  _only_  requires participation by the endpoints
  * Uses  _inference_  of PMTU based on correlation of packet-length and  _lack_  of acknowledgement
* Can we  _infer_  PMTUD at the IP/ICMP layer?
  * Yes, we can!
  * We’ve all used the “ping –m do -s…” test to zero in on path MTU at  _some_  point
    * Let’s bake that behavior into host’s IP interface implementations?


##### Decouple Interface and Path MTU?

PMTUD (all varieties) are only designed to detect path MTU that is  _lower_  than the local egress  _interface_  MTU

But, as we know,  _interface_  MTU is inherently untrustworthy.

Let’s “take the leash off” of path-MTU and allow it to probe up  _past_  the local interface MTU value.

Would allow “senseless victim flows” to realize  _actual_  path MTU, even though the origin network’s MTU had been “dumbed down” because of one weak-link somewhere upstream that only  _some_  traffic was routed through.
