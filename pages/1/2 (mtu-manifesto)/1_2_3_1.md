summary: "Assumptions guiding this analysis"
---
- Maximizing operational stability and efficiency in delivery of IT sericees is desirable.
- Undetected packet loss on IP networks leads to application performance problems, which adversely impacts operational stability
- MTU mismatches are an easily remediated cause of undetected packet loss
- Path MTU Discovery (PMTU) provides a mechanism for two hosts with an MTU mismatch between them to compensate and avoid adverse impact
  - But PMTU "in real life" is a fragile framework
- Ethernet and IP networks represents the overwhelming majority of enterprise networks
- Commonly adopted networks design practices result in widespread MTU mismatch
- Modern public/private cloud hosting architectures often involve multiple layers of nested encapsulation as part of recursive underlay/overlay services
- Remediating MTU mismatch introduces its own risks to operational stability
- A 1500-byte L3 MTU/MRU is universally supported by Ethernet network devices
- Some network nodes benefit significantly from "jumbo frame" (>1500-byte MTUs) capabilities
  - Block-storage over IP protocols, for example  (NFS, CIFS/SMB, FCOIP, etc...)
- Most devices on enterprise networks have explicitly configured network interface MTU values
- Most devices on enterprise networks consume DHCP services for IP address assignment
