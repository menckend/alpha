summary: "Is this even feasible? I hope so, but you knew things were going to get weird when you started reading something with the word 'manifesto' in the title."

If you create/maintain the software that implements "tunnel endpoints" on IP routers, please (pretty, pretty please - with a cherry on top) act on the suggestions below!

> Your in\-network\-tunneling devices are both  _“_ routers _” and_  “hosts”  \(please behave accordingly\) _ _
>
> - Maintain PMTUD state on Tu interfaces for destinations on the underlays \( _host _ behavior\)
> - Generate PTBs when an overlay packet can’t be encapped and sent to the underlay  \( _router_  behavior\)
> - Include the Tu interface’s  _path_  MTU when making the determination about whether MTU would be exceeded
