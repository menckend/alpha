Hello all/world; I'm Mencken.  I'm (in no particular order) a network architect, a life-long technophile, a husband, a parent, and a musician (a long-term recidivist bassist).

I also enjoy writing, but (until recently) I hadn't really written *just because I wanted to* in about twenty years or so.

Also recently, I found myself motivated to try to re-define and re-tool the process associated with my practice as a network architect.  I needed to push it (and myself) in a much more agile/iterative/continuous direction.  If I was going to evanglize the inevitability and desirability of infrastruce-as-code and NetOps process/culture, it seemed *only fair* that I should be working towards an "architecture as code" framework.

Long-story short, I started experimenting with Github "pages" and "actions" (and "projects") and doing a lot of futzing around with Jekyll configurations, Liquid templating, Saas/CSS, and javascript.  Along the way, I wound up with a baseline github repository that seemed like a pretty nice home for things I write.  So, here we are.

The works here are my own; you'll find them categorized under the drop-down arrows in the top-right. Adore/ignore/abhor them as you deem appropriate.  *Whatever* your take, I hope you find them as much fun to read as I did to write.
