## Hi there; I'm Mencken.  (Pleased to meet you.)

## I'm (not only, but mainly) a: network architect; life-long technophile; husband; parent; and musician.  

## I also enjoy writing, but (until recently) I hadn't really written *just because I wanted to* in about twenty years or so.

##  Also recently, I found myself motivated to try to re-define and re-tool the process associated with my practice as a newtork architect, needing to push it (and myself) in a much more agile/iterative/continuous direction.  If I was going to evanglize the inevitability and desirabiliyt of infrastruce-as-code / NeOps, it seemed "only fair" that I should be working towards "architecture as code".

## Long-story short, I started experimenting with a lot of Github's native "fringe" (not directly source-code-management related) but still interesting functionality.  Github pages turned out to be a very big part of that, and I wound up with conjuring a GH Pages / Jekyll baseline configuration that I decided was a decent framework for a personal site/blog/portfolio/whatever.

## So, here we are.

## All works presented here are my own. Ignore them or adore them as *you* best see fit.
