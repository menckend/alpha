## Greetings

Hi there; I'm Mencken.  I'm a network architect, life-long technophile, husband, parent, and musician.  I'm other things too, obviously, but I'll leave those to your collective imaginations.

## Me, me, me

I also enjoy writing, but (until recently) I hadn't really written *just because I wanted to* in about twenty years or so.

Also recently, I found myself motivated to try to re-define and re-tool the process associated with my practice as a newtork architect, needing to push it (and myself) in a much more agile/iterative/continuous direction.  If I was going to evanglize the inevitability and desirabiliyt of infrastruce-as-code / NeOps, it seemed "only fair" that I should be working towards "architecture as code".

Long-story short, I started experimenting with a lot of Github's native "fringe" (not directly source-code-management related) but still interesting functionality.  Github pages turned out to be a very big part of that, and I wound up with conjuring a GH Pages / Jekyll baseline configuration that I decided was a decent framework for a personal site/blog/portfolio/whatever.  I'm having fun learning how to coax things out of Jekyll and *torturing* myself trying to do things with Liquid that would be ten-to-thirty times easier in JS.  Getting source-controlled SVG diagrams embedded *nicely* into published pages has been particularly fun.  (By "nicely", I mean they render pleasantly in the published page, and are clickable to open in-browser in diagrams.net, and still remain source-controlled.)

## ...and, in closing.

So, anyway; here we are.

All works presented here are my own; you'll find them categorized under the dropdown arrows in the top-right.  Ignore them; adore them; ... *abhor* them (if you must).  Regardless, I hope you find them as much fun to read as I did to write.
